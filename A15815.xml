         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For it is one thing, to be <hi>in mans iudgement</hi>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:12058:42"/>in the ſtate of Reprobation, and another by <hi>Gods Decree</hi> of Predeſtination to be a Reprobate, and one that is for euer caſtaway. For the very <hi>Elect</hi> and cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen children of God, if we reſpect one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>outward appearance</hi> and will, bee ready to giue out our ſentence &amp; iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereby, vntill ſuch time as they be regenerate, effectually called, and borne againe by the Spirit of God, may be ſaid to be in the <hi>ſtate of Reprobation:</hi> that is, to be ſuch, as for the preſent haue gone further, nor made any further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe in the wayes of life, then hath he which is a Reprobate indeed.

But on the other ſide, if wee haue reſpect vnto the certainty and truth of <hi>Gods decree,</hi> which ſtandeth firme and ſure for euer: they can in no wiſe be ſaid to be ſo reprobated, and quite caſt away from the hope of grace; becauſe that in reſpect of the ſaid Decree, they are cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen and elected veſſels vnto life, and ſuch as ſhall be partakers of mercy,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:12058:43"/>though as yet, the fruit thereof in the grace of their regeneration, doth not begin to worke and be effectuall with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in them. So that, though in the <hi>ſecrecie</hi> of Gods Decree there is a diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and difference made, and ſome are <hi>veſſels of mercy</hi> prepared vnto honour; ſome <hi>veſſels of wrath,</hi> appointed vnto dis-honour; <hi>ſome</hi> are to bee <hi>partakers</hi> of <hi>life eternall; ſome</hi> contrariwiſe to be <hi>partakers</hi> of <hi>death euerlaſting:</hi> yet to the <hi>iudgement of man,</hi> within himſelfe, vntill ſuch time as hee is <hi>regenerate,</hi> and hath the teſtimony of the Spirit, to teſtifie and auouch vnto his heart and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, though hee be in the ſecret pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe elected; yet for the time, I ſay, hee ſhall find ſmall or no difference betwixt himſelfe, and thoſe that are Reprobates indeed, euen in the foreknowledge and counſell of God. Which <hi>indifferencie</hi> of the eſtate of the Elect and Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, (before the time of regeneration) ioyned with the <hi>vncertaine</hi> and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne time of the Lords calling, is a great reaſon, why that, though the man regenerate and renued, may bee aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:12058:43"/>of his ſaluation: yet may he not in defect of faith, and other graces of regeneration, conclude his owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, and ſay that he is for euer reprobated and caſtaway. For that, hee hauing yet a time and ſpace to liue, bee it neuer ſo ſhort a moment, the Lord may therein call him home, and gather him vnto himſelfe. The <hi>child</hi> cannot ſay that he is condemned, becauſe hee hath not faith: becauſe that when hee commeth to mans eſtate, the gift of Faith may be imparted vnto him. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>hee that is at mans eſtate,</hi> becauſe that in his old age hee may be receiued. Neither yet hee, whom <hi>old age</hi> hath wearied: becauſe that, if in health hee finde it not, yet in the laſt houre, and vpon his death-bed, the Lord may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowe the ſame vpon him, and ſupply his want.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, ſeeing that our <hi>vocation</hi> and <hi>effectuall calling</hi> (though in ſecret knowledge of God it bee certainly da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) in reſpect of vs is moſt vncertaine, whether it ſhall be when wee are yong, or when wee are old; whether this
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:12058:44"/>day or the next; this moneth, or the next yeere: ſurely the ſtate of the <hi>preſent time,</hi> wherein wee finde and feele our ſelues, can be no ſufficient Argument to reaſon and conclude of that, which we can tye or limit vnto no certaine time at all.</p>
               <p>For what reaſon, I pray you, were it for a man to ſay, I haue liued theſe twelue or fourteene yeeres, and yet am not called, and <hi>therfore</hi> I am a Caſtaway? Or I haue liued twenty, thirty or forty yeeres, and yet I finde no faith, and <hi>ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> I am condemned? Or I am old, weary, weake, ſicke and feeble, I doe looke euery houre to dye, I am vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of my life for an houre, or a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute of an houre, ſuch is mine infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: and yet I finde no comfort of my Calling: and <hi>therefore</hi> I ſhall not be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at all? As though God were bound of dutie, to order things according to our preſcription: or that either he were not able; or elſe were vnwilling at the laſt gaſpe, to giue vnto thee greater mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and more euident teſtimonie of his grace and fauour towards thee, then he
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:12058:44"/>did all thy life before. Let not any man preſume to <hi>preſcribe</hi> vnto the Lord what hee ſhould doe, or in what <hi>time</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> hee ſhould doe any thing; his own <hi>wiſedome,</hi> and his owne <hi>will</hi> and <hi>power</hi> are <hi>ſufficient</hi> in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe. Neither let any man whartle at, and <hi>why</hi> out the caſe with God; ſaying, <hi>Why</hi> doth he thus deferre the time, and put off the comfort of his elect and choſen? It is not meet, that the ſeruant ſhould pry ſo farre into the cloſet of his Maſters ſecrets. And who can reach, or who is able or meet to ſearch out the depth of his eternall counſels? Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lay thine hand vpon thy mouth with modeſty, and be it ſoone, or bee it late, doe thou ſtill obediently depend vpon the Lords good will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, which then ſhall take effect, when as it ſeemeth to his wiſedome moſt conuenient.</p>
               <p>Were it therefore granted, which is ſo much preſumed, in the wauering and doubting ſoule, that it were for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent vtterly deſtitute, and had no <hi>faith</hi> at all: yet this is no reaſon for a man to
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:12058:45"/>proue himſelfe a Reprobate: becauſe that no man in ſuch a caſe can in this life peremptorily conclude, that hee is a caſtaway, as hath been before ſhewed: though on the contrary, the man <hi>regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi> may be <hi>certainely</hi> aſſured of his <hi>ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,</hi> euen while he continueth in this life.</p>

Wilt thou therefore ſay thou haſt no <hi>faith?</hi> Nay, I rather infer, that thou haſt a <hi>faith,</hi> and that the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Adoption</hi> hath already laid the claime, and giuen the earneſt penny vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy heart: Not becauſe thou art not <hi>aſſured</hi> (for be it farre, that I ſhould ſo reaſon) but becauſe that though thou haſt not this; yet I finde the <hi>other to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens</hi> and arguments of <hi>faith</hi> to be ſeated in thy ſoule: In that thou art found thus heartily to <hi>mourne</hi> vnder ſinne, that thou <hi>lotheſt</hi> and <hi>deteſteſt</hi> thy wickednes, and doeſt ſo earneſtly <hi>deſire</hi> to be <hi>cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed</hi> and <hi>inueſted</hi> with the garments of <hi>Chriſts</hi> righteouſnes; whereby thou

               <p>For further proofe of this mine aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp; for our better inſtruction; let vs vſe an <hi>inſtance</hi> or two euen in common reaſon. The <hi>graft</hi> that is newly and of late planted, it hath ſo farre increaſed, that it hath brought forth buddes and leaues, but as yet no fruit: If now the queſtion be demanded, whether the graft be dead or not; euery one which hath but common ſenſe, will anſwere, that it is not dead, but hath a life, though as yet it hath no fruit, but only a ſhew of leaues and bloſſomes. If againe it be demanded, how it can be, that it ſhould effect theſe two, and not the fruit: the anſwere will be, that it is not neceſſary; becauſe theſe by the courſe of nature are precedent, and goe before the other. And therefore theſe, that is, the leaues and bloſſomes may be, and the plant by them may be ſurely knowne to haue life; though the other, that is, the fruit, be not yet effected. So ſay I of the <hi>plant of faith:</hi> Although it hath not as yet the fruit of full aſſurance, ſhewing forth it
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:12058:57"/>ſelfe: yet it hath the bloſſomes (that is) the ſorrowing for ſinne, the hearty de teſtation of ſinne, and the earneſt loue of righteouſnes. Is this <hi>faith</hi> now <hi>dead?</hi> or is it not at all, becauſe it hath not yet brought forth this notable effect of certainty and aſſurance? God forbid. But ſeeing it hath theſe other effects, ſo manifeſtly appearing; wee may aſſure our ſelues, that we haue a <hi>faith</hi> already ingendred in vs, which will bring forth that other excellent fruit of aſſurance in time conuenient.</p>

So <hi>faith</hi> that is ingendred as a yong Babe, in the wombe of the heart and ſoule, though by ſuch apparant motion, thou canſt not deſcry it to bee within thy ſelfe: yet in that alteration, that thou

But now thou art ſo affected towards them, that at the very ſight thereof thou art ſick; yea, ſo ſick, that thou art ready to ſwound, becauſe thou canſt not bee put preſently in poſſeſſion, and immediately enioy the full fruition of the ſame. Euery mi nute ſeemeth a moneth, euery day a hundred yeeres, vntill thy longing be ſatisfied, and that thou mayeſt take thy fill, and haue thy full repaſt vpon them. <hi>O bleſſed change,</hi> that is ſo full and plenteous with theſe ſo excellent fruits and effects of faith!

                  <hi>deteſtation</hi> of ſinne, a <hi>loue</hi> of God, a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerent feare</hi> to offend him, being to vs ſo gracious and louing a Father; a <hi>zeale</hi> of his glory, and an earneſt <hi>care</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire</hi> to liue according to his will, with many other ſuch like.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>effects</hi> (if our faith were a true faith indeed) did then ſhew forth themſelues in ſome meaſure, when as our faith was at that full tide, though faith being ſomewhat weakned, they ſeeme to be afterwards leſſened and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated in vs. But as for that <hi>famed faith,</hi> it cannot make this application of the promiſes of God, neither can it come with ſuch full aſſurance, to craue and obtaine remiſſion at Gods hands. For though it ſeemeth to bring forth a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ioy in the heart of him that hath it, &amp; therupon doth flatter himſelf in a bare conceit of forgiueneſſe: yet becauſe he doth not throughly enter into exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of himſelfe, it is but like a <hi>dream,</hi> and hee which hath this faith, is but as one that is <hi>aſleepe,</hi> who dreaming, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwadeth himſelfe that hee is increaſed mightily, and growne to a great and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:12058:63"/>goodly eſtate, whereas indeed his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is none other, but the very ſame ſtill and all one with that it was before. But of this in place more conuenient hereafter.</p>
               <p>Now to remooue this <hi>doubt of the truth of faith,</hi> we are not to looke ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiuely vpon our <hi>preſent ſtate,</hi> but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we are to caſt our eyes, and to look backe vnto that which went <hi>before.</hi> Whether when wee found the former peace and quiet of conſcience in aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of our forgiueneſſe, wee had not alſo thoſe effects in ſome meaſure, though not in the higheſt perfection, waiting and attending on it. For if they were, then wee may aſſure our ſelues, that wee had and haue true faith indeed, and that we are bleſſed, and for vs aſſuredly ſaluation is reſerued.</p>
               <p>For proofe and confirmation hereof,<note place="margin">3. Meanes of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</note> take this for the <hi>third meanes</hi> of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, viz. that <hi>true faith being once ingraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed, can neuer vtterly decay and fall away againe,</hi> though for a time it may bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated, weakned, and decreaſed. For whom God loueth, in them he plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:12058:63"/>this faith: and as he loueth vnto the end, &amp; with an euerlaſting loue, ſo his <hi>graces</hi> flowing from this <hi>loue,</hi> are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent for euer in his beloued children. And looke what good worke hee hath begunne, hee will ſurely finiſh and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme vnto the comming of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And therefore if once we haue found in vs the teſtimony of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of faith, to ſhew it ſelfe (though it doth not ſtill and alwayes ſo) yet let vs not deſpaire, knowing that faith may bee dimmed, but neuer extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, it may bee weakned, made faint and feeble, but cannot bee vtterly quelled and killed in vs. All this, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, which I haue ſayd, it is found by due and good experience, that by reaſon of this faintneſſe and feebleneſſe, whereunto faith is often ſubiect, there commeth vnto the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed and doubting Chriſtian, great griefe and ſorrow of heart. For when hee findeth in himſelfe a longing and deſire alwayes to bee ioyned with his head <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and to enioy the ſweet and comfortable preſence of the <hi>Spirit of
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:12058:64"/>God,</hi> proceeding of <hi>faith:</hi> he cannot to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerate nor beare the abſence thereof, without great ſorrow and mourning, which doth euidently appeare by the example of the <hi>Church,</hi> which being depriued for the tune, of this inward ioy of the preſence and effectuall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the Spirit, as though <hi>Chriſt</hi> were departed from her, is ſayd to <hi>riſe out of her bed,</hi>

               <p>And yet this <hi>mourning</hi> and <hi>ſorrow</hi> is ſo farre off from being a <hi>cauſe</hi> of ſuch <hi>diſtruſt,</hi>

For tell me, I pray thee, what is the cauſe that thou doeſt ſo mourne and ſigh? Is it not becauſe thou doſt thinke that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is departed from thee, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the comfort of the Spirit is not preſent with thee, becauſe thou findeſt not the ſame ioy and ſolace in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God, as heretofore thou haſt done, and becauſe thou haſt an earneſt longing and deſire to entertaine and
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:12058:64"/>harbour againe this Spirit of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in thy mourning ſoule, but canſt not, as thou thinkeſt, attaine to the ſame? Why, plucke vp thy heart, bee not diſmayd nor troubled herewith: but rather be thou aſſured, that theſe are <hi>motions</hi> and <hi>affections,</hi> ſo farre vnmeet for any man to ground <hi>deſpaire</hi> vpon, that euery <hi>ſigh</hi> and <hi>teare</hi> that is ſpent therein, is ſo many <hi>reaſons</hi> and <hi>argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> to <hi>ſtrengthen</hi> and <hi>confirme</hi> thy heart, that thou art a <hi>choſen</hi> Veſſell, and an <hi>elected</hi> Childe of God. Is it likely, thinkeſt thou, that hee that is <hi>vnregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,</hi> and abideth ſtill in the corruption of his fleſh, and taketh a pleaſure to walke in the filthy luſts thereof, ſhould take ſuch ioy and ſolace in the Spirit, as that hee could not tolerate or abide to haue the ſame abſent from him? Would he mourne and ſigh, becauſe hee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draweth himſelfe from him? Or would hee long after the Spirit, and wiſh and deſire to finde and feele it worke with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him? I aſſure thee no: Theſe <hi>affections</hi> are not of the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> but of the <hi>Spirit.</hi> And therefore ſee how much thou art
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:12058:65"/>deceiued, that whileſt the Spirit <hi>worketh</hi> thus <hi>effectually</hi> within thine heart; yet thou <hi>complaineſt</hi> of the <hi>want</hi> therof, and ſayeſt thou feeleſt it not, thou findeſt it not. And the reaſon whereby thou art led to think and iudge thus of thy ſelfe, is, becauſe that thou being ſo intentiue vpon one only fruit, forgetteſt that theſe alſo are notable effects of faith.</p>
               <p n="5">5.<note place="margin">5. Meanes of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</note> Another thing whereof we muſt take good heed, and whereof wee muſt beware in this caſe, is, that in <hi>viewing</hi> and conſidering the <hi>faith of other</hi> the ſeruants of God, wee be not ouermuch intentiue, in compariſon of it <hi>with our owne eſtate.</hi> For hecreby oftentimes it commeth to paſſe, that whiles wee too much gaze vpon <hi>their perfection,</hi> and then looke downe againe vpon our <hi>own infirmities,</hi> we fall not onely to a <hi>diſlike,</hi> but oftentimes to a maruellous <hi>diſtruſt</hi> and <hi>despaire</hi> of our owne eſtate: Much like to him, that gazing too much vpon the <hi>Sunne,</hi> hath his eyes dazled with the brightneſſe thereof, that when he look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth downe againe vpon the <hi>earth,</hi> hee hardly ſeeth any thing at all, or at the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:12058:65"/>leaſt, not ſo liuely a reſemblance as hee did before. In this point, therefore, we muſt remember: <hi>Firſt,</hi> that it is not the <hi>perfection,</hi> but the <hi>truth</hi> of faith that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired: For if thy <hi>faith</hi> be <hi>true</hi> and <hi>vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fained,</hi> though it be in thine eyes <hi>weake</hi> and <hi>feeble,</hi> it is ſufficient. The <hi>hand</hi> and <hi>arme</hi> that is not dead indeede, but only taken with a <hi>ſhaking palſey,</hi> is able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue a <hi>reward</hi> that ſhall be giuen, as <hi>effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clually,</hi> though not ſo <hi>ſteadily,</hi> as is the hand and arme, being <hi>ſtrong</hi> and <hi>ſound</hi> without ſuch imperfections: So <hi>faith,</hi> though <hi>faint</hi> and <hi>feeble</hi> in thy ſight, and cumbred with many doubting cogitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as it were with a ſhaking palſey, yet ſeeing it is not <hi>dead,</hi> but <hi>liuely,</hi> aſſure thy ſelf that it is ſufficient to receiue at Gods hands, the <hi>penny</hi> &amp; <hi>reward</hi> of eternal life.</p>
               <p>Secondly, thou art to conſider, that God <hi>beſtoweth</hi> his <hi>graces</hi> in ſuch <hi>mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,</hi> as he <hi>thinketh good</hi> in his owne wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; to ſome he giueth <hi>more,</hi> to ſome <hi>leſſe,</hi> and not to all in like and equall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, and yet to euery one of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect <hi>ſufficient</hi> vnto ſaluation.

                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:12058:66"/>committed vnto him, and another but <hi>two,</hi> and yet hee that hath but <hi>two,</hi> ſhall enter into his Maſters ioy.<note place="margin">Mat. <hi>8.</hi>
                  </note> The <hi>Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rions faith</hi> (as we alſo read) was ſtrong; for there was not found the like in <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> by the teſtimony of <hi>Chriſt</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. <hi>Iairus</hi> faith was weaker, and not ſo ſtrong, as appeareth by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. And the faith of <hi>him that cried for help againſt his vnbeliefe,</hi> more weake then that of <hi>Iairus;</hi> and yet becauſe it was a true &amp; liuing faith, he that had the weakeſt, had notwithſtanding ſufficient to obtain the things he ſued for. So that it is with the Elect of God in regard of faith, as it was ſomtime with the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> in gathering <hi>Manna</hi> in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, he that gathered <hi>much,</hi> had nothing ouer, and he that gathered <hi>leſſe,</hi> had no want: So the Choſen of God, they that are indued with the <hi>greateſt</hi> meaſure &amp; gift of faith, are but wel, &amp; haue <hi>nothing to ſpare,</hi> and they that haue the <hi>leaſt</hi> and skantieſt portion, yet haue <hi>ſufficient</hi> to feed on <hi>Chriſt</hi> vnto eternall life. And heereupon it is, that the Apoſtle affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that to <hi>euery one is giuen grace, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:12058:66"/>to the meaſure of the gift of Chriſt.</hi> And that <hi>God hath dealt to euery one the meaſure of faith.</hi> And againe,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>as he will.</hi> So that faith then, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gifts and graces of God, are giuen, but not at the appointment of man, but of God, and not in a quantity to all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, but in ſuch manner and meaſure to euery one, as vnto God ſeemeth beſt, &amp; as he in his wiſdom ſhall iudge to be for euery one moſt conuenient. Neither are weto think, that this is any ſtrange man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of dealing in God. For we ſee plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that God diſpoſeth not of al perſons after a like ſort. For ſome he appointeth to endure <hi>longer, ſharper</hi> &amp; <hi>greater com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats,</hi> &amp; in them a <hi>greater gift of faith</hi> he ſeeth to be requiſite: Some again he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daineth to <hi>leſſer, ſhorter, &amp; more eaſie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts,</hi> &amp; in them <hi>a leſſer meaſure</hi> ſerueth.</p>
               <p>And further, I pray thee marke, how in iudging of the <hi>meaſure</hi> and <hi>quantitie</hi> of thy faith, and comparing it with the faith of others, thou may ſt be deceiued:</p>
               <p>For thus thou vſeſt to reaſon and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute, and that againſt thy ſelfe: I read
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:12058:67"/>and ſee alſo by experience of diuers the ſeruants of God, which euen in the <hi>first encounter</hi> againſt temptations, through the great ſtrength of their faith, haue preuailed &amp; gotten the victory, &amp; that in a ſhort time: But I contrariwiſe haue ſtruggled and ſtriuen, and that a <hi>long time;</hi> but as it appeareth, all in vaine, for ſtill I am foyled, and alwayes goe away with the worſt, and therefore I know, that in compariſon of theirs, my faith is moſt faint and weake.</p>
               <p>To this thy reaſon I anſwer,<label type="milestone">

                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> that the <hi>prouidence</hi> of God; is heere to bee conſidered, who at his owne plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure <hi>diſpoſeth</hi> all things; and ſince hee hath <hi>appointed</hi> thee to a longer and a more dangerous conflict, perſwade thy ſelfe alſo, that hee vouchafeth to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter ſtrength vnto thee, that thou mayſt bee able to endure the fame: and this hee doth to this end, that in thy weakneſſe his power might bee ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forth, and that thy victory ouer thy great and grieuous enemies, might bee the more famous, and that hee, I meane God himſelfe in thee, ſhould bee the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:12058:67"/>more glorified. And of this bee thou bold, that although the temptations wherewith thou art aſſaulted, be great and of long continuance, yet hee will not ſuffer thee to be tempted aboue thy ſtrength; nor longer then the time which he hath limited and appointed; but in his time will prepare a way for thee to eſcape.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, I ſay, that this thy <hi>reaſon</hi> is not good. For all this while thou doeſt compare together the <hi>euents,</hi> but not the <hi>aſſaults</hi> of thy ſelfe and others. For the aſſaults being different, it may and doth often come to paſſe, that the weake and feeble faith may get and obtaine a quicker and a more ſpeedy conqueſt, then that which is ſtrong and mighty. As for <hi>example.</hi> There are <hi>two perſons diſeaſed,</hi> the one a <hi>man</hi> of middle age, the other a <hi>child</hi> yong and tender: the diſeaſe of them both is grieuous; yet we ſee it oftentimes ſo to fall out, that the child ſooner recouereth and attaineth vnto health, then the man: &amp; the man to be a lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger time diſquieted with ſicknes then the child. Shall vvee
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:12058:68"/>now ſay, that the child is ſtronger then the man, becauſe he firſt recouered? Or will you not rather ſay, that the diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes were <hi>not in like meaſure</hi> in both, but in the child in a leſſer quantitie, in that by ſo little ſtrength, he is ſo quickly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered: and in the other in greater meaſure, in that, the greater ſtrength notwithſtanding, hee could not in lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger time be cured? The <hi>reaſon</hi> is like. Is therefore the aſſault leſſe and of ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter continuance? Thy faith then may with more caſe, and in ſhorter time o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome it, though it bee but weake. And on the other ſide, is the aſſault ſtrong, and of longer time continued? Shrinke not at the matter, neither bee thou any whit diſmayed or diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged therefore. For, albeit thy faith is conſtrained, to continue longer in fight before it can preuaile: yet be ſure, that thou ſhalt at laſt obtaine the victory, and triumph ouer thine enemies moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly.</p>
               <p>As the <hi>Bee</hi> oftentimes, out of the bitterreſt <hi>Flower,</hi> ſucketh or gathereth <hi>Honey:</hi> ſo out of theſe fierce aſſaults,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:12058:68"/>whereby thy ſoule is troubled, thou mayſt to thy comfort gather a Reaſon and Argument, to proue the greatneſſe and ſtrength of thy Faith, whereof thou doeſt ſtand ſo much in doubt. Thou thinkeſt that incountring with great aſſaults, and not able at the firſt to ouercome them, that therefore thy faith is weake and feeble. But the caſe is otherwiſe. For <hi>great temptations,</hi> doe import <hi>a great meaſure</hi> of the gift of <hi>Faith. For God,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alledged, <hi>tempteth none aboue mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and aboue that which hee is able to beare.</hi> And therefore as God meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth our temptations, according to the meaſure of our faith, chaining and muz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zling vp the Tempter, that hee ſhould not haue his full ſwindge againſt vs, and miniſtring ſtrength vnto vs, that we ſhould be able to reſiſt the ſame: So we againe, by the <hi>meaſure of our tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> and aſſaults, may learne the <hi>mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the gift of faith</hi> that is beſtowed vpon vs. For faith is neuer ſo well tryed in her ſtrength, as in the time of temptations: for which cauſe alſo they
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:12058:69"/>are called the <hi>tryall of faith.</hi> Thus then a man may reaſon with thee: Are thy <hi>temptations great?</hi> Thy <hi>faith</hi> then is alſo <hi>great.</hi> For otherwiſe God would neuer haue laid ſo great a tryall on thee; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he had knowne thee by his grace, to be inabled to indure it.</p>
               <p>And againe, on the contrarie, thy <hi>temptations</hi> are <hi>ſmall:</hi> ſhall I therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre, and ſay, thy faith is alſo weake? I dare not ſo reaſon, becauſe I know the caſe is otherwiſe. For the <hi>greateſt faith</hi> many times ſhall finde <hi>ſmall,</hi> as well as <hi>great temptations:</hi> and yet is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be accounted weake, but rather ſtrong ſtill, and able to beare away the triumph in a greater combate. For the care of God, in meaſuring of temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, is not in reſpect of the ſmalneſſe of the quantitie, that it ſhould not bee too little, but alwayes <hi>fit</hi> and <hi>equall,</hi> and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <hi>inferiour</hi> to the ſtrength of faith: But in the greatneſſe, that they be not ouermuch, for our abilitie to ſuſtaine. And therefore, it is not ſaid, that <hi>God tempteth not vnder,</hi> but that he tempteth <hi>not ouer and aboue that wee are able to
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:12058:69"/>beare.</hi> Wherefore thou mayſt here ſee and marke againe, how this doctrine ſcrueth ſtill, to <hi>increaſe and further thy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort, but not to breed or bring deſpayre</hi> at all. For he that hath the greateſt tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, though he haue a ſtronger and a longer combate, and ſome great trouble therewith: yet he hath an aſſured Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſtrength of Faith, which in time conuenient ſhall get the vpper hand. And on the other ſide, he that hath but ſmall aſſaults, and ſuch as hee can eaſily maſter; beſides, the comfort he is to haue, in that hee can ſo ſoone ſubdue his tryalls: let not the <hi>weaknes</hi> of his <hi>aſſaults,</hi> be any reaſon vnto him, to conclude thereupon the <hi>weaknes</hi> of his <hi>faith,</hi> and thereby take a diſcomfort in himſelfe. And let both theſe ſorts of men hold themſelues contented with the meaſure of faith, which God hath vouchſafed to impart vnto them, and alwayes ſhew themſelues thankefull vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God for the ſame.</p>

               <p>And hereupon it falleth out, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his heart by this meanes poſſeſſed with ſuch a <hi>ſiniſter iudgement</hi> of his own eſtate, that is ready to writhe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert all to the worſt that may be; hee groweth to many gricuous paſſions in himſelfe. And vnto all theſe inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, he is led as it were ſtep by ſtep, and by degrees, for want of due remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the ſtate of Chriſtians, after the time of their Regeneration. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, let vs ſee, what <hi>comforts</hi> may bee had, for the <hi>helping</hi> and <hi>curing</hi> of this cuill alſo.</p>
               <p>Now becauſe the queſtion is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the <hi>weaknes:</hi> but herewithall alſo of the <hi>truth of repentance;</hi> whether it be repentance indeed or not, I thinke it very expedient and neceſſary, by way of <hi>preparation: Firſt,</hi> to ſearch out <hi>what true repentance is:</hi> and <hi>ſecondly,</hi> how and by what <hi>markes</hi> it may be knowne and diſcerned, from that which is fained and hypocriticall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repentance</hi> in Scripture hath two ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall names, to expreſſe and declare the nature thereof. One in the <hi>Prophets,</hi>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:12058:71"/>where it is called <hi>a turning</hi> or <hi>returning</hi> vnto God. And the other in the <hi>Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,</hi> where it is called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which ſignifieth <hi>a change</hi> or <hi>alteration of the minde.</hi> So that as <hi>turning</hi> or <hi>returning,</hi> implyeth a <hi>leauing,</hi> and an <hi>acceptation;</hi> a <hi>leaning of that euill way,</hi> which before wee followed, and an <hi>accepting of that good &amp; right path,</hi> w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> before we ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: And as <hi>changing</hi> importeth <hi>two</hi> things; the <hi>corruption of the former form,</hi> and the <hi>induction of a new:</hi> So <hi>repentance</hi> hath in it <hi>two parts;</hi> a <hi>for ſaking of ſinne,</hi> and <hi>a following after righteouſnes;</hi> a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion from euill,</hi> and <hi>a change and alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, vnto that which is good.</hi> For if we will bee accounted in the number of thoſe which are truely <hi>repentant,</hi> wee muſt of neceſſitie, be caſt as it were in a new mould. Our old ſtamp muſt be vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly razed and defaced, and a new muſt be imprinted: and this is that which the <hi>Scripture</hi> meaneth, when it ſaith, <hi>Wee muſt be borne againe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>two parts,</hi> in Scriptures are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in other termes; <hi>mortification,</hi> and <hi>vinification. Mortification,</hi> whereby
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:12058:72"/>the deeds and corruptions of the fleſh are mortified, ſtricken dead and quelled in vs; and therefore is called the <hi>morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the fleſh. Vinification,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are quickened, incouraged and pricked forward vnto righteouſneſſe, the Spirit getting the maſtery and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence aboue the fleſh; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is called the quickening or <hi>vinifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit.</hi>

               </p>

And hereupon it is that they mourne and ſigh onely, for that they ſee and perceiue themſelues, by reaſon of their great ſinne and wie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſes, by force and by the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the <hi>Law,</hi> to bee brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a dangerous or a damnable eſtate; But as for the <hi>ſinne it ſelfe,</hi> which by them is committed day by day, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it bee, in the proper nature thereof, neuer ſo filthy or abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, yet do they <hi>not mourne for it,</hi> but remaine ſtil in them, with as great <hi>loue,</hi> and take as great <hi>pleaſure</hi> therein, and

               <p>Againe, this <hi>ſorrow</hi> proceeding of the <hi>feare of puniſhment of ſinne,</hi> by the Law bringeth forth <hi>deſperation</hi> in the Reprobates, as appeareth in <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Iudas,</hi> and others; if it ſtay onely in the <hi>Law,</hi> and haue no regard vnto the <hi>Goſpell:</hi> For the <hi>Law</hi> bringeth nothing elſe but <hi>terrour</hi> and <hi>iudgement.</hi> The <hi>Law</hi> indeed would <hi>iustifie,</hi> and vpon inſtification miniſter vnto man, great conſolation, but it muſt in all points, according to the purity thereof be <hi>ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled,</hi> which wee through our weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe are not able to doe: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore inſtead of <hi>iustifying,</hi> wee reape a <hi>curſe,</hi> and inſtead of <hi>conſolation,</hi> doe

               <p>For the further manifeſtation here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, amongſt many other <hi>examples</hi> of
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:12058:76"/>the Scriptures, which to this purpoſe may bee produced, I will vſe but one onely, and that is the <hi>example</hi> of the <hi>Prodigall ſonne,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke <hi>15.</hi>
                  </note> of whom it is written:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> that he would needs haue his portion of goods deliuered vnto him; hee would ſhake off the yoke of his fathers gouernement; hee would be a Traueller, and take his iourney into a far Countrey, where he is ſaid to waſte and conſume his goods and Patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny with licentious and ryotous liuing. Hereby is his ſin manifeſted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> after his goods were in this manner waſted and conſumed, there fell a plague of famine and dearth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Land; hee began to bee pinched with famine, and that in ſuch great and extreme manner, that for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe in this his great neceſſity, he would faine haue filled his hungry belly, with the huskes appointed for the Swines meate, which his Maſter appointed him to keepe, but none was found ſo pittiful to giue them vnto him: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in wee ſee the iuſtice of the <hi>Law</hi> exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted vpon him: and hereupon grew
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:12058:76"/>his <hi>firſt ſorrow, voide of comfort,</hi> when hee ſaw himſelfe, by his wilfull diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, and looſeneſſe of life, to bee brought to ſuch a miſerable caſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Hee being in this manner plagued, and by that plague driuen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſorrow, hee is ſaid to come vnto himſelfe, and then calleth to minde the good eſtate euen of his fathers ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, in that they had bread and victuals enough to ſuſtaine their hun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gry bodies, and hee as one like to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh with hunger. Hee then reſolueth with himſelfe againe to returne, and to go to his father, with an humble con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and acknowledgement of his fault, and humble ſubmiſſion to his fathers order, and a full aſſurance that hee ſhall finde fauour at his Fathers hands: and all theſe (as it were) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dewed with the teares of his ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full heart, that hee had ſo grieuouſly offended ſo kinde and ſo louing a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And in all theſe points doe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare vnto vs, the comfortable promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and doctrine of the <hi>Goſpell:</hi> ſo that vnto this ſecond mourning, begunne
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:12058:77"/>thus vpon the due conſideration of the lewdneſſe of his life on the one part, and the goodneſſe of the perſon againſt whom he had offended on the other part, it appeareth that there was annexed an aſſured hope to obtaine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of his fault at his fathers hands, a receiuing againe into fauour, and a comfort and helpe vnto him in theſe his miſeries: otherwiſe ſurely he would neuer thus haue reaſoned with himſelfe, as hee did, bringing his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon from the good eſtate of his fathers ſeruants, to confirme in himſelfe the hope of his owne; neither would hee haue beene ſo reſolute to haue retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to his fathers houſe, and in ſuch manner to haue humbled himſelfe, and confeſſed his fault, had there not beene in him a great <hi>confidence</hi> that he ſhould be againe receiued.</p>
               <p>I might hereunto adde <hi>the example</hi> of <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> who (no doubt) <hi>mourned,</hi> and yet had a hope of <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion,</hi> and therewithall a <hi>ioy,</hi> and therefore was bold to come vnto <hi>Chriſt;</hi> but for breuities cauſe I will
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:12058:77"/>not ſtand heereupon. Here I would not haue the ſorrowfull ſoule to bee <hi>ouer-captious,</hi> and to take all things in the worſt part. For when, I ſay, that there is a <hi>ioy,</hi> a <hi>peace,</hi> and a <hi>faith, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending</hi> vpon this godly ſorrow; I would not haue him therefore thinke, that it is alwaies <hi>felt,</hi> in manifeſt and open motion: And therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee findeth it not ſo cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in himſelfe, that therefore his ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row is but hypocriticall and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit.</p>
               <p>For you muſt vnderſtand, that this <hi>ioy, peace</hi> and <hi>faith,</hi> as it oftentimes falleth out, are <hi>not,</hi> at the firſt, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily <hi>perceiued;</hi> and that becauſe the eyes of our mindes are often ſo dim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and dazled, with the exceſſe of ſorrow and mourning, that wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee &amp; perceiue them, as otherwiſe wee might; and yet for all this, the truth of the ſame is ſtill abiding &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in vs, as may very well be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, euen by thoſe weak and <hi>feeble</hi> motions, which proceed therefrom. <hi>Feeble,</hi> I ſay, <hi>in our ſight</hi> and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:12058:78"/>but otherwiſe <hi>in themſelues ſtrong</hi> and mightie. This is proued vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, by the <hi>example</hi> of <hi>Peter,</hi> who (no doubt) by the inward teſtimony of the Spirit, did indeed know aſſuredly that his ſinne committed in denying his Maſter, ſhould be remitted and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen him; and yet hee is ſaid to haue ſorrowed very greatly,<note place="margin">Math. <hi>26.</hi>
                  </note> (for he depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from amongſt the High Prieſts ſeruants) and to weepe bitterly.</p>
               <p>But it is more plainely proued in <hi>Dauid,</hi> who hauing receiued before, a warrant from God himſelfe, by the mouth of the Prophet <hi>Nathan,</hi> that his ſinne was pardoned, yet he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward grew to ſuch exceſſiue mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in regard of his ſinne, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,<note place="margin">Pſal. <hi>51.</hi>
                  </note> So that it ſeemed hee had almoſt forgotten this promiſe of forgiueneſſe; and therefore hee very earneſtly cryeth out, and prayeth vnto God, that hee would waſh away his ſinnes: Not that <hi>Dduid</hi> wanted faith, or were vtterly in this his ſorrowing, depriued of that peace and ioy I ſpake of; but becauſe his mourning being ſo
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:12058:78"/>exceſſiue, and the euidence of faith for the time, was ſo feeble in regard of his ſinne, whereupon he continually fixed his eyes, that hee felt not theſe things, in ſuch meaſure and perfection as hee deſired, or rather ſeemed to feele them not at all: And therefore hee deſireth God, that hee would <hi>reſtore the Spirit of comfort;</hi> as though all comfort had forſaken him, and as though hee had felt no ioy and peace in regard of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and remiſſion. And yet, no doubt, all this while hee had a <hi>faith,</hi> hee had a <hi>ioy</hi> included in him, as it appeareth after in the ſame <hi>Pſalme:</hi> For hee could ſcarce vtter fiue verſes more, but it burſt out in open confeſſion of his mouth. <hi>A contrite and a broken heart thou wilt not deſpiſe:</hi> as who would ſay, I am broken, ſad and ſorrowfull, but yet I haue a ſtedfaſt hope, and a full aſſurance of thy fauour; for ſuch bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and mourning hearts, thou wilt not deſpiſe and caſt away, but wilt be gracious and good vnto them: yea, and though hee ſeemed not to feele it before, yet hee was not able now to
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:12058:79"/>conceale it any longer, no not when hee was in the greateſt combat and ſtruggling and contending with his ſinnes.

               <p>THeſe things being rightly conſide<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red: I would wiſh the <hi>ſorrowfull ſoule</hi> not to be ſo <hi>raſh</hi> and <hi>peremptory</hi> in his conceit, as though euery thing is no ſooner <hi>borne,</hi> but is ſtraightway of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie <hi>brought to perfection:</hi> But learne to qualifie and allay theſe his haſty cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, at the doings of the Husbandman, and vſe him as his Schoole-maſter in this caſe, to teach him a profitable leſſon. The <hi>Husbandman,</hi> when he hath toyled greatly in dreſſing his land, in caſting his ſeed into the ground, doth not ſee his corne preſently eared; yet doth hee nothing miſ-doubt the increaſe thereof: For if he ſee it but chitted in the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, he reſteth patiently for the time conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, expecting and looking for a happie and a plentifull <hi>harueſt,</hi> in due time to follow vpon his labours: So thou, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:12058:80"/>at the firſt thou findeſt ſuch a ſmall growth of theſe graces of God in thee, yet deſpayre not. For if they bee as yet but chitted, and doe appeare in thine eyes very ſmall, ſtay the time with patience, and aſſure thy ſelfe that the Lord in his time will giue a further bleſſing. And what if thy <hi>peace,</hi> thy <hi>ioy</hi> and <hi>comfort</hi> be not growne to ſuch <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection?</hi> yet if thou findeſt in thy ſelfe in theſe extremities, that thou canſt but <hi>looke</hi> ſo vpon the <hi>graces</hi> and <hi>mercies</hi> of God, as ſuch as may be beſtowed vpon thee hereafter; though as yet thou canſt not reſolue thy ſelfe, by reaſon of thy frailty, that they are imparted to thee; and withall doeſt finde a boldnes in thy ſelfe, to appeare before his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and to approch and draw neere vnto the Throne of Grace, to cry and call for them, though it bee with ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtnes, as confounded in thy ſelfe: yet this <hi>little ſhew of faith,</hi> that ſo quickly voi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deth and vaniſheth out of thy ſight as a thing of nothing, is a <hi>certaine argument,</hi> that That thy ſorrow and mourning was <hi>not altogether void of faith,</hi> in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:12058:80"/>of the remiſſion and forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of thy ſinnes.</p>

               <p>Moreouer, with this hatred is alſo to be ioyned a <hi>ſhame and confuſion in the perſons repentant, becauſe of ſinne;</hi> and that not onely in reſpect of <hi>Man</hi> (for ſo the very Hypocrites are aſhamed of their ſinnes, and therefore ſeeke by all meanes poſſible to hide and keep them from the ſight and knowledge of men) but in regard of <hi>God,</hi> and in conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>filthineſſe of the ſin it ſelfe:</hi> and ſo become as men <hi>daunted</hi> in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, that euer they were ſo <hi>vngracious</hi> to <hi>commit</hi> ſuch filthines and iniquitie, whereby their ſo gracious a GOD ſhould be <hi>offended.</hi> And with this alſo <hi>a free confeſsion and acknowledgement of the ſame their ſinne vnto God,</hi> nothing diminiſhing or abating, but truely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing the hainouſnes thereof.</p>

                  <hi>This godly ſorrow,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>what feare hath it brought forth?</hi> So that he that is truely repentant, ſhall eaſily finde in himſelfe this feare and dread to ſinne againe, as hee had done before-time.

               <p>Hereupon it is, that <hi>Dauid</hi> affirmeth of himſelfe, ſaying:<note place="margin">

               <p>Secondly, that euen in him alſo that hath had in him manifeſt fruits of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and is <hi>throughly called</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated,</hi> this care is often <hi>ſmothered</hi> and decayed; ſometime for a <hi>ſhorter,</hi> and ſometime for a <hi>longer</hi> ſeaſon, as hereafter ſhall appeare.</p>

                     <hi>Marke</hi> 4.</note> is a <hi>loue and affection vnto righteouſnes,</hi> wherein we are to note, that as that godly hatred wherof we haue before intreated, is ſaid to be becauſe of ſinne; and becauſe that ſinne was an offence to God: So the <hi>loue of righteouſnes</hi> is partly, for that it is <hi>true righteouſnes</hi> indeed; and partly, becauſe they know aſſuredly, that it is a thing both <hi>pleaſant</hi> and <hi>acceptable</hi> in the ſight
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:12058:84"/>of <hi>God.</hi> Wherein we may note a <hi>diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> alſo betwixt the true <hi>repentant</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and the <hi>hypocrite.</hi> For the <hi>hypocrites</hi> haue alſo a certaine <hi>ſhew</hi> of loue &amp; affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vnto righteouſnes (but farre vnlike the former) inſomuch as we ſhall often ſee them very hotly to contend &amp; ſtriue in defence of godlineſſe: and oftentimes they will appeare to be ſo zealous in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe of godlines, that they will be ready to ſuſtaine dangers for it. If ſinne be to be puniſhed, they will bee therein very forward, as appeareth in the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and amongſt them chiefely in the <hi>Phariſes;</hi> men appearing outwardly very hot and <hi>zealous;</hi> not onely for the <hi>Ceremoniall,</hi> but alſo for the <hi>Moral Law</hi> of <hi>Moſes.</hi> In giuing <hi>almes,</hi> they are <hi>bountifull;</hi> In <hi>praying,</hi> very <hi>deuout;</hi> in <hi>faſting,</hi> very <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious</hi> and <hi>holy:</hi> There is no godly exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of Chriſtians to be vſed; wherein they would be found inferiour to any.

<pb n="160" facs="tcp:12058:89"/>and the fleſh and the powers thereof, ſometime in them preuailed ſo much, and ſo mightily, that if we reſpect their doings for the time, they ſeemed to haue little or <hi>no ſenſe and feeling of ſinne</hi> at all, but as men no whit regenerate, did giue themſelues ouer to commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of ſinne, and thoſe moſt odious and abominable, and without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, did ſhew and behaue themſelues, as men ſecure and careleſſe for the time.

And for that the time alſo of this <hi>deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> as experience teacheth, is not alike to all, but in ſome is of <hi>ſhorter,</hi> and in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of a <hi>longer</hi> continuance, as the Lord in his wiſdome ſhall appoint, I therefore conclude, that this ſayd time of deſertion may not bee any cauſe, ſo hardly to iudge of the ſtate of any.</p>

                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.25.</note> if hee loſe his owne ſoule. And therefore though our poſting and haſty iudgement cannot in very deed preiudice or foreſtall the finall ſentence of the euerlaſting Iudge, yet it is not to bee poſted ouer and paſſed vpon, ſo lightly as men commonly do ſuppoſe: but with good and deepe deliberation, as in ſuch a
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:12058:95"/>weighty cauſe is requiſite.</p>
               <p>The accuſers (as I haue ſaid) are <hi>Satan</hi> and <hi>Sinne,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Satan and ſinne his Accuſers.</note> and theſe are found oftentimes, not onely falſe <hi>Euidencers,</hi> but alſo enuious <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> and ſuch, as indeed doe not wiſh any good, but harme, yea vtter deſtruction vnto man both in body and ſoule. And therefore ſince it is manifeſt to be true which I haue ſaid of them, we may ſee that there is no hope at all of any fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor to be had at theſe <hi>accuſants</hi> hands, but that rather it is moſt aſſuredly to be looked for, that they will ſpew out their poyſon againſt the true ſeruants of the Lord, ſo far as they can, to the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deſtruction of the children of God.</p>
               <p>Againſt theſe ſo malicious and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uious <hi>Accuſers,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Faith his Aduocate.</note> ſtill vrging the hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſneſſe of thine iniquities, <hi>Faith</hi> as a wiſe and prudent <hi>Aduocate,</hi> ſtandeth to pleade the cauſe, who although ſhe alwaies telleth the truth, and ſpeaketh with great comfort, yet is ſhe often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſo <hi>ſhouldred</hi> out &amp; <hi>ſuppreſſed</hi> with the clamorous out cries of theſe malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Accuſants, that ſhe can hardly be
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:12058:95"/>ſuffered to ſpeak in ſuch free manner as ſhe would: And if ſhe be ſuffered, yet ſhe is ſo <hi>interrupted,</hi> that her ſpeech is found to be but <hi>faint and feeble;</hi> So that if ſhe bee not well attended vpon, ſhe can ſcantly be heard. And hereupon it commeth to paſſe, that the <hi>conſcience</hi> of man, giuing care moſt to the euidence of the <hi>Accuſers,</hi> and not attendant to that which <hi>Faith</hi> pleadeth in defence, is ready to giue <hi>ſentence</hi> and <hi>iudgement</hi> againſt the <hi>ſoule,</hi> to the condemnation thereof. But I would aduertiſe euery man in this Seſſion of tryall vpon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, ſtill to haue a care, that he be <hi>not ouer-haſty,</hi> to pronounce the doome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the cauſe thorowly heard: And let him conſider with himſelfe, that as in worldly cauſes, he being appointed as an Arbitrator or a Iudge, in equity ought as well to lend one of his eares to the <hi>Defendant,</hi> as hee doth the other to the <hi>Plantiffe,</hi> and ſo not to heare onely what is obiected, but alſo what in truth is to the ſame anſwered. So in this caſe alſo of the <hi>ſoule,</hi> let not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man attend onely and giue eare to
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:12058:96"/>that with theſe accuſers ſhall obiect a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſoule, but rather hearken to that which faith vttereth in defence, for that ſhee pleadeth ſtill in <hi>fauorem vitae,</hi> for lifes cauſe. And herein this is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be remembred alſo, that one <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and whiſpering word of <hi>Faith</hi> and of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> is and ought to bee accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and accounted for a greater and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer teſtimonie tending vnto life, then are all the earneſt cryes of theſe accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants tending vnto death, appeare they neuer ſo faire, and be they colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ouer with neuer ſo great likelihood and probabilitie.</p>

The thing therefore that herein we are to haue a ſpeciall eye vnto, is <hi>not</hi> the great <hi>meaſure</hi> and <hi>quantitie;</hi> but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>truth of repentance.</hi> For although

Would God thus <hi>moderate</hi> affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions as hee doth, and in ſuch gentle meaſure on vs as he doth, if he did <hi>hate</hi> vs? Would he be thus chary and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full as he is, not to quench the ſmall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings, and ſpring of our faith and confidence, and of our hope in him? Or, if it were in hatred, and not in loue and fauour towards vs, might hee, or would hee not rather cut and breake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder the very cable of our truſt and affiance, that ſo wee might vtterly pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, and be conſumed with <hi>Cain, Iedas, Inlian,</hi> and ſuch others? How ſoeuer you doe iudge, yet ſurely I ſuppoſe and thinke, that if <hi>Hatred</hi> were <hi>Moder atrix</hi> in afflictions, which God layeth vpon his ſeruants, that this would then bee

               <p>

               <p>Now then anſwer mee, I pray thee, thou that in this ſiniſter manner doeſt iudge hatred to be in God towards his children, and art greatly troubled and diſquieted in minde, with this euill and wicked cogitation. Was not <hi>Dauid,</hi> a

               <argument>
                  <p>Satans Obiection againſt the former doctrine anſwered.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>BEfore that I enter into the <hi>Anſwer</hi> to Satans vſuall <hi>Obiection,</hi> made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the former doctrine, I am to counſell thee to take heed vnto thy ſelfe, and to beware of his <hi>policie</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times. For if thou wilt be ready to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept at his hands, whatſoeuer hee will aduenture to profer vnto thee; hee will ſoone bring thee to take at his hands, <hi>Copper,</hi> nay, <hi>droſſe,</hi> for <hi>Gold,</hi> deadly <hi>poyſon,</hi> for a ſoueraigne <hi>Potion,</hi> and that to thy confuſion. Try therefore and examine his obiections thorowly, marke from whom they come, and to what euill end and purpoſe they are made; ſo ſhalt thou the more eaſily withſtand him in his temptations, and with more ſpeed preuaile againſt him.</p>
               <p>Although this doctrine concerning my firſt poſition, bee (as I hope) ſo plaine, that euen the ſimpleſt may vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:12058:111"/>it; and with ſuch reaſons confirmed, as it hath pleaſed the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt</hi> to miniſter vnto mee in that reſpect; yet is the enemy of God and all godly men, bold to take excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt the ſame, and in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner frameth his <hi>Obiection:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Obiect. </seg>
                  </label> It is recorded in the Scriptures, that theſe which you ſo often call <hi>afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> are indeed <hi>iudgements,</hi> and Gods <hi>vengeance</hi> denounced and executed on Gods <hi>enemies,</hi> and thoſe againſt whom his wrath and anger is incenſed. And for confirmation hereof, wee may produce many <hi>examples,</hi> euen out of the Scriptures, but in a matter ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant, I thinke it needleſſe. By this Obiection thus framed and vttered, it euidently appeareth, that the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger thereof (<hi>Satan</hi> by name) will be a Serpent ſtill of great ſubtilty, ſtill inuenting and forging new deuices, to effect his deuiliſh purpoſes. And therefore it is not to be maruelled at, if he thus beginne to make aſſault vpon thee in this manner, by force of this Obiection, to raze out of
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:12058:112"/>thy minde, the truth and certainety of all that before hath beene, by ſo many <hi>Arguments</hi> confirmed; which his malicious craft, that it may the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther appeare, Ict vs <hi>examine</hi> and try his <hi>Obiection</hi> thorowly, and diſcouer the falſhood and inſufficiency thereof, ſo farre forth as by the holy Spirit of God, wee ſhall bee thereunto in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Propoſition</hi> is this,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Obiect.</hi> That af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions are ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of Gods an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</note> that <hi>ſuch like afflictions as thou endureſt, are threatned in Scriptures, as iudgements and effects of Gods haired, wrath, and anger vpon the wicked.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A ſubtili <hi>temptation,</hi> whereby this enemy deceiueth very many: But let vs a little dwell and ſtay thereupon, ſyft and examine it thorowly, and ſo the fraud thereof ſhall more eaſily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare. Whereas it is ſaid in the <hi>Obiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> that God doth threaten ſuch like things, as <hi>iudgements,</hi> and vengeance <hi>for ſinne,</hi> to be executed on the <hi>wicked:</hi> It cannot bee denyed, the <hi>Scripture</hi> to this end is indeed plentifull. But what of this? Not any thing in truth can
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:12058:112"/>hereout bee gathered for <hi>Satans</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. But herein his craft doth the more appeare: in that vpon ſo good a ground, hee goeth about to erect ſuch a defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med building, and to ſet vp his ſubtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. For by how much the foundation is more true, by ſo much, his in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent concluſions will ſeeme to bee more ſtrong and forcible. And then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially it lyeth vs vpon, to bee more circumſpect and wary to cut him ſhort, and to preuent him in ſo malicious a purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Let vs now come to the view of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans Sophiſtry.</hi> The <hi>queſtion</hi> is of the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of <hi>God.</hi> The <hi>Propoſition</hi> propoſed is true indeed: But yet too weake and altogether vnable to conclude the <hi>que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</hi> For thus he reaſoneth: Theſe <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries</hi> and <hi>afflictions</hi> are <hi>ſometimes</hi> the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of Gods hatred: And therefore they are ſo in <hi>thee</hi> too.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This <hi>Argument</hi> cannot hold. For that which is <hi>ſometime</hi> ſo, will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beare a <hi>generall</hi> inference; nor yet a <hi>particular</hi> or a <hi>ſpeciall concluſion.</hi> If a man ſhould thus reaſon: The Sun doth
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:12058:113"/>
                  <hi>ſometime</hi> harden the thing it ſhineth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; therefore it hardeneth <hi>Waxe</hi> alſo: E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery petit <hi>Logician</hi> would bee ready to ſcoffe and leſt at the baldnes of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. But to inſiſt euen in <hi>Satans</hi> owne <hi>example:</hi> Theſe troubles and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries proceede <hi>ſometimes</hi> from the loue of God, and therefore they doe ſo to the very <hi>Reprobates</hi> and Caſtawayes. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the <hi>antecedent</hi> be true, yet the <hi>concluſion</hi> can neuer be made good: and ſuch is the concluſion of Satan. For what reaſon, I pray you, is in this? It is <hi>ſometime</hi> ſo, and therefore ſo at <hi>all times:</hi> It is ſo in <hi>ſome,</hi> and therefore ſo in <hi>all:</hi> Or it is ſo in <hi>Iudas</hi> the Traytor: <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is ſo in <hi>Peter,</hi> or ſome one other of the Apoſtles. As though that which is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed truely of the <hi>one,</hi> muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie without exception be verified of <hi>another.</hi> Let <hi>Satan</hi> therefore firſt proue this his propoſition to be <hi>generally true,</hi> that is, that theſe <hi>afflictions</hi> doe <hi>alwayes</hi> come from the <hi>hatred</hi> of God: Or elſe this; and ſuch like particular concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, will ſtand him in no ſtead. But this proofe hee can neuer bee able
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:12058:113"/>to make. Hold him therefore at this pinch, and thou ſhalt, to thy great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, haue a notable victory againſt him.</p>
               <p>Thus thou maiſt now ſee one piece of <hi>Satans</hi> malicious <hi>craftineſſe</hi> diſcouered, which he vſeth in this reaſon, to deceiue men afflicted withall. But yet this is not all the <hi>poyſon</hi> that lurketh vnder the faire ſhow of words in this the Serpents rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as ſhall anon appeare. He is indeed very pregnant in his proofes; ſo is hee alſo as painfull and plentifull in his mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtructions, wreſting all to his owne purpoſe, that hath but onely a very little ſhow or likelihood to fauour the cauſe he hath in hand, and ſtriueth to proue. Whereupon, it commeth to paſſe, that as in many other, ſo euen in this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon alſo, he very ſlightly paſſeth ouer the matter, by the crafty confuſion of words of <hi>diuers</hi> ſignifications, as though they ſignified and imported <hi>one and the ſelfe ſame</hi> thing: And therefore the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and ſooner to deceiue either thee or any other, hee thus ſubtilly reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth:<note place="margin">Satan his reaſon.</note>
               </p>
               <p>God (ſaith the Scripture) is <hi>angry</hi>
                  <pb n="210" facs="tcp:12058:114"/>with thoſe whom he puniſheth: And therefore it cannot be, but thou art <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> of him, and ſo out of the tale and number of his children.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> This is (no doubt) a very abſurd kind of reaſoning, and argueth ſufficiently, from what Spirit it proceedeth, and therefore is thereafter to bee liked of and allowed. What Scripture euer taught, thus to ioyne &amp; confound thoſe things together, which God hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed? Cannot the <hi>winde</hi> ſtirre and moue, but it muſt needs bee a <hi>tempeſt?</hi> Cannot the <hi>Sunne</hi> bee <hi>dimmed</hi> with a Cloud, but it muſt vtterly <hi>loſe his light?</hi> And cannot <hi>God hee angry</hi> and diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but hee muſt needs <hi>hate</hi> and finally <hi>caſt away</hi> for euer? Is there no <hi>meane</hi> to be had? None eaſier way to be found? muſt all of meere neceſſitie and of force be ſtretched on the rack of extremities? Indeed <hi>Satan</hi> would haue it ſo, and therunto goeth about by this his ſubtil reaſon to perſwade: But yet <hi>Gods Spirit</hi> doth teach vs far otherwiſe, that God ſheweth himſelfe to bee <hi>angry</hi> and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with many of his <hi>ſeruants,</hi> and
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:12058:114"/>deare children, whom notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he <hi>hated not,</hi> but moſt dearely <hi>loued;</hi> that hee oftentimes hath not onely threatened; but alſo actually executed <hi>puniſhments</hi> vpon them, from whom he alſo promiſeth that he will not take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his mercy for euer.</p>
               <p>This doctrine of the Spirit of God, by the example of <hi>Dauid, Hezechiah,</hi> and many others in the Scriptures, is prooued to be as certaine, as that which is moſt certaine: and therefore euen in this point, as in al his others, <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> is found to be a <hi>lyar,</hi> &amp; his reaſon to be of no force, for that ſo ſubtilly he maketh no <hi>diſtinction</hi> and <hi>difference,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>hatred</hi> and <hi>anger</hi> of God: As though they were indifferent times, of one nature, and of one ſignification. And therefore if in any place, he find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth theſe afflictions to proceed of <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger:</hi> he ſtraitway inferreth, that it is of <hi>hatred:</hi> As though God <hi>hated</hi> all thoſe with whom, and that moſt iuſtly, he is <hi>diſpleaſed.</hi> Which is not ſo, as hath been ſhewed. God (in ſome ſort) may bee ſaid to be <hi>angry</hi> with his children, and
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:12058:115"/>in anger to afflict and puniſh them: But hee can neuer bee ſaid to <hi>haue</hi> them: For theſe two are things <hi>different</hi> in God.</p>
               <p>God is ſaid to <hi>hate</hi> thoſe, whom ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his <hi>Decree</hi> hee hath excluded from <hi>mercy,</hi> though he grant them life and proſperitie here on the earth for a while: or in his puniſhments, hee doth in anger conſume, that is, in Iuſtice, ſeeke onely and intend their condemnation: But it is <hi>not</hi> ſo to his <hi>Elect</hi> and Choſen. For if in them he <hi>hateth</hi> any thing, ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is nothing but <hi>ſinne</hi> alone; he hateth <hi>not</hi> their <hi>perſons,</hi> as he is ſaid to hate the perſons of the Reprobate. But yet God may be ſaid to be <hi>angry</hi> with his <hi>Elect:</hi> that is, he may haue a will to <hi>puniſh ſinne</hi> in them in what manner it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him; and he may lay his <hi>temporall puniſhments</hi> vpon them, as being diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with their ſinnes and offences, and yet be ſtil in <hi>loue</hi> affected towards them; as the <hi>Father</hi> that is incenſed to <hi>anger</hi> againſt his <hi>Sonne</hi> that hath done amiſſe, and therefore alſo taketh the Rod and puniſheth him, and yet ſtill he <hi>loueth</hi> his
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:12058:115"/>child, neither can, for this anger, be ſaid to hate him.</p>
               <p>And it is wel to be obſerued that there is a <hi>difference</hi> too, betwixt this <hi>anger</hi> of God towards his <hi>Children</hi> and the <hi>Caſt-awayes,</hi> vnto the <hi>Elect</hi> and the <hi>Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate.</hi> Vnto the <hi>Elect</hi> it is <hi>temporall,</hi> ſhort and for a time: For <hi>hee will not alwayes chide, neither keepe his anger for euer.</hi>

               <p>That <hi>God hath promiſed proſperity vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his ſeruants,</hi> is not to be denyed, but may ſafely, and with ſufficient warrant eaſily bee granted: Nothing by the grant hereof will be gotten to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Satans cauſe, but much will bee found thereby to increaſe the comfort of GODS children.

<pb n="230" facs="tcp:12058:124"/>beate his wits neuer ſo much, yet ſhall he neuer be able to make this his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion good.

               <p>IF this which I haue ſomwhat largely diſcourſed, be thought to be too little and inſufficient for confirmation of mine aſſertion, neither wil content your minde; take, I pray you, a little paine, &amp; wade on w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> me a litle further in this matter, &amp; I truſt, by the aſſiſtance of the Spirit of God, euen by a very familiar <hi>example,</hi> to make the caſe ſo plaine, that you ſhall euen as it were of force bee brought to confeſſe my <hi>Poſition</hi> to bee true, whatſoeuer the enemy of mankind

But when all are thorowly skanned, they will euidently appeare to be more preſumptuouſly vttered, then duely proued, as now ſhall bee eaſily ſeene. Let it be <hi>granted</hi> (for diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions cauſe, but not that it is true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed) <hi>that the promiſes of God doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne this preſent life onely,</hi> (I meane the <hi>promiſes</hi> of <hi>proſperitie</hi>) and that they ſhall be here performed alſo; Say that the <hi>righteous</hi> ſhall <hi>not fall for euer,</hi> that is, ſhall <hi>neuer</hi> fall, but ſhall euer flouriſh: Let <hi>Satan,</hi> vpon theſe two grounds, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne to ſettle his mayne concluſions: yet I doubt not, but that vpon the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of his reaſon, it will cleerely appeare, that his concluſions are but vaine, light, and of no weight or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance.

               <p>Thou vile and corrupt fleſh; thou ſubtill and enuious Serpent, why doe yee reaſon thus againſt mee, and that without all ſenſe and reaſon?

Is the pruned Tree paſt recoueric? and doth the Hearbe dye, becauſe it is crop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped? Yee are very buſie and earneſt to tell me ſtill of miſeries and afflictions; but yee make no mention of the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:12058:133"/>fruit of them at all, theſe yee keepe ſecret, and hide them from mee. And why? becauſe ye ſee them as they are indeed, to be full of all proſperity. What if they ſeeme in themſelues ſo bitter as ye pretend? Doe not ye ſee and finde, how the children of God haue alwayes proſpered, euen in the very loweſt ebbe of all Aduerſitie? Was <hi>Ioſeph</hi> then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone proſperous, when as he liued with his Father <hi>Iacob:</hi> or when hee was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted as a <hi>Steward</hi> in the houſe of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>typhar,</hi> and had the ouerſight &amp; charge of all the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> ſubſtance?

No, no, it is farre otherwiſe: for <hi>Ioſeph</hi> euen in <hi>priſon,</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> in the <hi>Lyons den</hi> did proſper. For I finde, that euen in theſe ſtinking and dangerous places, <hi>God</hi> was <hi>preſent</hi> with them, did get them fauour, and with honour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered them out of their diſtreſſe. Ye beat much vpon the preſent paines, but ye neuer conſider how God doth tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per them, and qualifie his ſeruants in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during and ſuſtaining of them. In
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:12058:134"/>this caſe it is with the ſeruants of God, as it was with <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> the more oppreſſed, the more he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpered and increaſed. Theſe <hi>miſeries</hi> and afflictions are not <hi>axes</hi> to cut vp by the rootes, but onely the Lords <hi>pruning kniues,</hi> whereby hee cutteth away the dead and rotten branches, that his grafts may grow the better, and their inward vertues may increaſe and ſprout the ſooner. Ye neuer conſider <hi>the end and iſſue</hi> of theſe afflictions, that repay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all with profit, as appeareth by <hi>the examples</hi> of theſe and ſuch like. Were not, thinke ye, the miſeries and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> good and profitable, whereby he was aduanced to ſo high a place of the Kingdome, as to haue all at his command? Was not the fierie furnace as great aduantage to <hi>Shadrach</hi> and his fellowes, being vnto them a ſtep vnto great honour?

                  <hi>like a roring Lyon, and ſeeking whom he may deuoure,</hi> hath his new inuentions, new motions, and new temptations, wherewith hee doth aſſault the ſilly weake conſcience.

               <p>By which his doings, he the ſooner perſwadeth, and by perſwading pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaileth; becauſe that all men, for the moſt part, carrying an enuious eye, are giuen and inclined to thinke and iudge, both for the time preſent, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie which they indure, no griefe to be like or worthy to be compared vnto their owne. Yea, their iudgement by <hi>Satans</hi> policy is ſo corrupted in this reſpect; that although, euen in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, they haue ſuſtained farre greater and more grieuous afflictions; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are paſt and ouergone, and this now preſent &amp; working on them, they can hardly be ſo perſwaded: Thus therefore, or in ſome ſuch manner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth Satan to ſet vpon them:</p>
               <p>Thou ſpeakeſt of miſeries and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions of others:<note place="margin">Another aſſault of Satan.</note> and I ſee how that indeed, as thou ſayeſt, the <hi>ſeruants of God</hi> haue beene <hi>deliuered</hi> and rid from them, and haue gotten the vpper hand with aduantage: but what of this? what is this to <hi>thee?</hi> Doeſt thou thinke to
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:12058:135"/>thruſt thy ſelfe into the company, and to be accounted in the number of theſe ſeruants of thy God? No, no, thou art gretly deceiued herein. Indeed they ſuffered afflictions, they had many troubles, but neuer any like to theſe of <hi>thine:</hi> they had troubles indeed, but <hi>none ſo extreme,</hi> ſo intolerable as theſe which thou doeſt indure: <hi>Theirs,</hi> in reſpect of <hi>thine,</hi> were but as fly-bitings: <hi>Thine</hi> are the very <hi>meſſengers</hi> of wrath; nay, they are very <hi>brand-markes</hi> of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Iudgement. Thus, or in ſuch like manner, <hi>Satan</hi> reaſoneth, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times greatly preuaileth in his doings, whiles the broken conſcience is too in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiue vpon his owne priuate extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and too too credulous to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to <hi>Satans</hi> perſwaſions, and to yeeld faith vnto his ſubtill inchantments, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſmall or no regard at all vnto the end whereunto he directeth his practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.

<pb n="259" facs="tcp:12058:138"/>in the <hi>primitiue</hi> age of the <hi>Church,</hi> after the times of the Apoſtles, it would (I thinke) force any heart, though it were as hard as the Adamant, to relent and melt with griefe: when as without all regard of <hi>Sex,</hi> care of <hi>age,</hi> or regard of <hi>eſtate,</hi> the <hi>virgin</hi> and the valiant <hi>man at armes,</hi> the <hi>infant</hi> and the <hi>age,</hi> the <hi>wife</hi> and the <hi>husband,</hi> the <hi>father</hi> with his <hi>ſonne,</hi> and the <hi>mother</hi> with her ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and guiltleſſe <hi>babes,</hi> were condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned without all remorſe and pity, to the ſuffering of moſt brutiſh and cruell tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: Some leauing all, and forſaking their houſes, goods and ſubſtance, were forced to flie into Deſarts, holes, and caues of the earth, for ſuccour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe: Others, not ſo eſcaping the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants hands, depriued of all their riches and eſtate, were grieuouſly tormented: Some <hi>whipped,</hi> ſome <hi>buffeted,</hi> ſome <hi>rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,</hi> ſome <hi>torne in pieces,</hi> ſome hauing hands, leggs, and other members cut a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, their fleſh lanced and gaſhed with kniues and razors, their faces mangled, their eyes, ſome pricked with ſharp quills, and ſome quite pulled out, ſome
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:12058:139"/>hanged, ſome drowned, ſome burnt to aſhes at ſtakes, others broyled on gred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>irons, and roſted on ſpits, ſome torne and rent with wilde horſes, and others thrown to moſt ſauage and cruell beaſts, to be deuoured. So that it cannot bee, but that the Chriſtian heart muſt needs be greatly grieued, to read in ſeuerall the things that are recorded of them.</p>
               <p>But leſt theſe things mentioned thus in generall, ſhould ſeeme to you of little importance, and ſmally pertaining to the purpoſe I haue in hand: Out of ſuch an infinite number, which haue in this ſort endured ſuch cruelty, I thinke it good to make recitall of a few parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, wherby (I truſt my) poſition will be ſufficiently confirmed. And yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, giuing you thus much to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, and generally to obſerue, That during the heauy times of theſe perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions, beſides the particular torments which euery one endured, all and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one, that did but take vpon him to profeſſe himſelfe, and ſay hee was a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> had the whole State and Kingdome, wherein hee liued, bent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:12058:139"/>him, his goods (by the lawes) in danger to bee confiſcate, in ſtead of a rightfull Iudge, hee had not onely a Miſcreant, but alſo a moſt cruell Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to decide his cauſe, who rather bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied his head to deuiſe torments, then how to ſet downe the doome with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. His friends and worldly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts would forſake him, being ſuch as no whit fauoured, but moſt poiſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully maligned the cauſe of Chriſt. Life could not be had, but bailed with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny miſeries; and death, though wiſhed for, yet could not be attained vnto, but through the troubleſome &amp; outragious tempeſts of moſt extreme <hi>calamities.</hi> So that if thou reſpect now, the loſſe and want of theſe worldly comforts, I perſwade my ſelfe, they can in no caſe be inferiour vnto thee. But theſe are but light in reſpect of the particular tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, moſt wofull and lamentable, which in the cauſe of <hi>Chriſt</hi> they endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, whereof now, God ſo permitting, thou ſhalt haue a taſte.<note place="margin">Romanus, <hi>a Martyr.</hi> Euſeb. lib. <hi>8.</hi> cap. <hi>20.</hi>

It ranne ouer his fleſh, waſted and conſumed the ſame, and pierced euen vnto the marrow bred within the bones: So that his whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was therewith larded and diſtilled, much like vnto dropping and diſtilling wax.

                  <hi>Engliſh</hi> tongue, as they bee ſet downe in ancient Writers, then to trouble this ſmall Treatiſe, with any further diſcourſe of the ſame: Hoping that theſe few are ſufficient to ſet before thee, and to giue ſome little taſte, what great and <hi>grieuous afflictions</hi> the <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>ſeruants of God</hi> haue ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and beene partakers of in this life.

<pb n="267" facs="tcp:12058:142"/>more extreme paines &amp; torments in their bodies then theſe? Inſomuch, that if by the outward accidents, wee might iudge of the finall eſtate of the ſoule, you may iudge theſe, of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to haue beene ſmitten of GOD and plagued, and euen in earth to haue receiued the very ſentence of eternall death vpon themſelues. But this manner of iudgement muſt bee ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended; for notwithſtanding theſe externall and outward accidents be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falling their bodies, they reſted, and continued ſtill the Elect and Choſen of the Lord, euen vnto the death; the cup whereof, in defence of their Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters cauſe, they moſt gladly taſted of, how grieuous ſoeuer the torments and afflictions were, which their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies ſuffered and endured.</p>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> And <hi>partly,</hi> by the <hi>recitall</hi> of Gods exceeding <hi>mercy</hi> and compaſſion vnto his Seruants, alledging that his eyes are alway fixed on them, his eares are euer open to their cryes, that hee is tender and carefull ouer them, as the

               <p>This reaſon of <hi>Satan,</hi> thus amply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, the more ſubtilly that it is by him couched, the more forcibly it prcuaileth with the weake and diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſoule, to the dangerous ouerthrow thereof. For whereas it hath beene before ſhewed, that both the <hi>Elect</hi> and <hi>Reprobate</hi> are in deed <hi>partakers</hi> of afflictions; Satan by this his reaſon would perſwade, that the <hi>continuance</hi> of afflictions, in reſpect of time, and the <hi>delay</hi> vſed of God, in ſhewing forth his helpe, are vndoubted <hi>diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences,</hi>
                  <pb n="273" facs="tcp:12058:145"/>and plaine <hi>markes,</hi> whereby the one from the other may very eaſily be <hi>diſcerned</hi> &amp; known. And to further him in this his purpoſe, he taketh no ſmall <hi>aduantage</hi> of the <hi>imbecility</hi> and weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which is found in man: who ſo long as his wounds are but freſh and greene, can the better tolerate and abide the bearing of them, becauſe hee conceiueth ſome hope of ſome quicke and ſpeedie deliuerance: But when, after long expectation, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth his hope to bee fruſtrated, and after long tryall, ſeeth hee can finde no eaſe, (although hee hath vſed all poſſible meanes for the ſame) then hee beginneth to deſpaire of himſelfe, and to make a queſtion and doubt of his eſtate: Wherein hee is found to be like vnto a <hi>ſicke man,</hi> which hauing tryed all the helps of <hi>Phyſick,</hi> and yet finding no helpe for the curing of his diſeaſe, beginneth then to diſtruſt of life, whereas before ſuch tryall made, hee ſuſpected little danger of death in himſelfe.</p>
               <p>To preuent <hi>Satan</hi> of his purpoſe,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:12058:146"/>and for the ſtrengthening of the <hi>weake</hi> Chriſtian, it ſhall not be amiſſe; nay, I thinke it neceſſary, as before of the other reaſons of the Aduerſarie, ſo of this likewiſe, to ſhew the weakeneſſe and inſufficiencie; that it being knowne, wee may ſee and perceiue the better, how little faith is to bee giuen to his perſwaſions. In which doing, as a counter-blaſt againſt this <hi>tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of <hi>Satan,</hi> I thinke it good, heere to place and ſet downe my <hi>fourth Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> as a reſolute, and an vndoubted truth, which was this:</p>
               <p>That <hi>the greatnes &amp; continuance of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries and afflictions,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The fourth Poſition.</note> 
                  <hi>nor the delayes which it pleaſeth God to vſe, in ſhewing forth his help, are good differences betwixt the iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Elect and Reprobate, in this life;</hi> &amp; therefore (as may be wel added) no ſufficient reaſons to proue, that a man is excluded and barred from the loue and fauour of God. If it were ſo, that God were at the appointment of any other, and that any ſhould or might preſcribe vnto him any order to bee obſerued in his doings, then
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:12058:146"/>this reaſon of <hi>Satan</hi> did carry ſome force with it: But ſince his power and authority are ſo <hi>abſolute,</hi> that hee is to order all things after his owne plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and to be ordered by none, <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi> reaſon muſt needs fall to the ground. As in all other the doings of God, ſo in this alſo, the will of God muſt ſtand for a ſufficient reaſon, to ſatisfie vs withall. And therefore wee muſt obſerue, that God doth not mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure our miſeries, or his owne deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, by the tale of daies, moneths, yeeres, or any times; but the ſpeciall thing that hee therein reſpecteth, as in all other his actions; is, <hi>firſt,</hi> his <hi>owne Glory;</hi> and <hi>ſecondly,</hi> the <hi>good of his Children.</hi> And therefore for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement and furtherance hereof, hee taketh ſuch times, as in his owne Wiſedome hee ſeeth, and knoweth, to be moſt meet and conuenient. So that be it ſooner, or bee it later, this day, or a month, or a yeere hence, all is one to him, howſoeuer it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth contrary to vs. Now where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>Satan</hi> ſeemeth to take hold of the
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:12058:147"/>long continuance of afflictions, it is to no purpoſe. It is eaſily proued, that God vſeth this manner of doing for moſt iuſt <hi>cauſes</hi> knowne vnto himſelfe. If it were otherwiſe; to what end then ſerue the <hi>exhortations,</hi> ſo many, and ſo pithy, vnto patience, conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and perſeuerance, as wee finde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in the Booke of God, that we ſhould patiently ſtay and waite the Lords leaſure, vntill hee vouchſafe to ſend deliuerance?</p>
               <p>Againſt the doctrine of this <hi>Poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Satans obiection.</note> Satan now taketh exception, and in this manner obiecteth and reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to the contrary: God hath <hi>promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed</hi> to heare when men cry vnto him, and to deliuer them whenſoeuer they ſhall call vpon him for helpe.

                  </label> It cannot bee denyed, but is to be certainely granted, that GOD
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:12058:147"/>hath promiſed as much as is by <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> obiected, and although hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the time, and (as wee in our owne iudgement doe ſuppoſe) doth ſtay his helping hand, in ſuffering vs to continue ſtill vnder the Croſſe; yet is hee not forgetfull, or vnmind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of his promiſe, nor doth any thing againſt his nature, being true in all his words and workes.</p>
               <p>There is ſome thing more in this point to bee conſidered of, which Satan here craftily <hi>concealeth:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> that <hi>man</hi> (as I haue ſaid) is in no band preſumptuouſly to <hi>preſcribe any time</hi> vnto God, wherein he ſhould performe his promiſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> the Lord doth <hi>know</hi> what is moſt <hi>meet</hi> and <hi>expedient</hi> for vs, and therefore will haue men to be exerciſed-vnder the Croſſe, ſome <hi>lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> and ſome a <hi>ſhorter</hi> time, not as men doe <hi>thinke,</hi> but as hee in his wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome <hi>ſeeth</hi> to bee for euery one moſt profitable.</p>
               <p>And <hi>thirdly,</hi> that in all, <hi>Hee</hi> may principally be <hi>gloryfied.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="278" facs="tcp:12058:148"/>
               <p>In the iudgement of man, becauſe men obtain not their requeſt at the firſt, ſecond, or third time, it appeareth that God doth not heare or regard the cry of his ſeruants: but it is (as I haue ſaid) farre otherwiſe. For when the <hi>time</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned ſo long before, of God, is <hi>come,</hi> when he ſeeth it to be moſt <hi>commodious</hi> for vs, and moſt for his <hi>owne glory;</hi> then will he heare, then will he grant in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie their Petitions, and then will hee ſhew himſelfe a powerfull God, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer his people out of their diſtreſſe. <hi>Examples</hi> to proue this, beſides the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of the Scriptures, wee haue many. Of the which multitude, one or two in ſo plaine a caſe ſhall ſuffice.</p>
               <p>Great (no doubt) was the ſeruitude and bondage of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and ſo farre off from eaſe thereof, that when <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> were ſent from the Lord for their deliuerance, their miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries were the more increaſed: and I thinke that no man doubteth of their crying vnto God for helpe, in the long time of continuance thereof: yet at the laſt, when Gods appointed time was
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:12058:148"/>come, that hee would bee glorified in <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and the <hi>Egyptians, Iſrael</hi> was, by a mighty hand and ſtretched out arme, deliuered from the fiery furnace of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and ſent on their way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the promiſed Land, and <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his hoſt purſuing after them, were vtterly confounded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dauid</hi> is proued to haue found God, ſometime a very <hi>ſpeedy</hi> helpe at hand, ready to deliuer him, and ſet him free from perill and danger: yet ſometime againe, he <hi>continued</hi> a longer ſeaſon vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the heauy burthen of afflictions, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch, that with great anguiſh and trouble of heart, hee complaineth as though God had quite forgotten him, that God had caſt him off and forſaken him for euer.</p>
               <p>And hereupon it is, that in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> he ſaith, that he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and yet he was not heard, that God did hide his countenance, and turne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his face from him. That he cryed day and night, and ſtretched out his his hands all the day long, euen vntill his throat was hoarſe and dry with cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:12058:149"/>vpon God, and yet he was not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. A plainer and more ſufficient te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie and example, for the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing of <hi>Satans</hi> ſubtill <hi>Obiection,</hi> I thinke thou canſt not haue. And now for thy further conſolation, <hi>confer thine eſtate</hi> with the eſtate of <hi>Dauid.</hi> What canſt thou finde in thy ſelfe, in reſpect of the <hi>continuance</hi> of miſeries and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, that is not eaſily found in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid?</hi> and what, in reſpect of <hi>earneſt cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and calling vpon God for helpe, can there be found in thee, that was not in him? Nay, if not in both theſe points, yet in the later, I perſwade my ſelfe, thou art farre inferiour, and commeſt nothing neere vnto him. Yet this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, and ſeruant of the Lord, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing ſo long time vnder ſo heauy a burthen of afflictions, almoſt waſted and conſumed with griefe and woe, and crying ſtill vpon the Lord, although he found no comfort at the firſt; yet was hee not vtterly caſt off or forſaken of God, but at the laſt taſted and felt the helping hand of the Lord to his great and ſingular comfort. And ſo thou al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:12058:149"/>although thou doeſt cry and call vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Lord in thy troubles, and canſt not obtaine thy requeſt at the <hi>firſt;</hi> yet doe not thinke that God therefore doth neglect thee, or that he hath caſt thee off for euer: But as thou haſt beene taught before, <hi>ſubmit</hi> thy ſelfe to his good will and pleaſure: <hi>Abide</hi> his time appointed, and that with patience: So ſhalt thou at the laſt <hi>finde</hi> and <hi>taſte</hi> of the Lords fauour, to thy endleſſe comfort.</p>
               <p>I might adde here many ſuch <hi>exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> for the further ſtrengthening of thee in this point, but that as I haue ſaid, it is needleſſe:<note place="margin">1. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.17</note> we haue comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of God, to pray continually, and that we ſhould,<note place="margin">

<pb n="291" facs="tcp:12058:154"/>of Gods hatred, and tokens of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall reſection of them.

               <p>ALthough I haue before diſcourſed of diuers temptations, wherewith the afflicted ſoule by the Enemy is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted, and in diſcourſing, haue ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what met with Satans obiections, and to my power vſed ſome reaſon, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent the euill which may come thereof, and after theſe paines taken, am now drawing neere to an end, and concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this matter, yet there is ſtill one <hi>temptation</hi> remaining, which in no wiſe is to be omitted and let paſſe, for that it
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:12058:160"/>is many times attendant, euen vpon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Gods deare children, and at that <hi>time</hi> eſpecially, when they approch and draw neereſt vnto their end: And that is <hi>the feare of death,</hi> and the vnwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which they finde in themſelues to die. Vpon which feare and vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſſe <hi>Satan</hi> taketh no ſmall <hi>aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,</hi> to further his wicked purpoſe, and that in moſt earneſt manner, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that his time, wherein he is to ſhew forth his malice againſt ſuch a party, is but ſhort, and therefore it behoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth him now to exerciſe his wits, and to vſe ſome reaſons whereby hee may with the more facility, driue ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed ſoules into deſpaire. This, hee knoweth, may be the better &amp; more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily effected, becauſe he findeth men to be ſo terrified &amp; appaled with the feare of <hi>death,</hi> as that they are loth and moſt vnwilling to taſte of the cup therof, but haue rather a deſire, ſtill to abide and continue in this vale of miſeries, wherein vexations, troubles and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiets doe greatly abound: euen as though there were none other, heauen
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:12058:160"/>but heere, no bleſſedneſſe to be looked for and found, but in this life. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Satan ſeeing men in ſuch ſort af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, and hauing ſuch opportunity offered, taketh occaſion in this or ſome ſuch like manner, to make aſſault vpon the diſtreſſed ſoule.</p>
               <p>Firſt, hauing muſtred into the minde and remembrance of ſuch fearefull and vnwilling perſons, all thoſe things wherewith they haue beene moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted, and wherein they haue taken ſome great pleaſure in this life, as <hi>wife, children,</hi> kindred, friends, acquaintance, companions, lands, goods, cattell, and ſuch like, <hi>Satan</hi> preſenteth this earthly ſtate before them, in the moſt pleaſant &amp; beautifull ſhew that may be. Again, he <hi>razing</hi> out and defacing, as much as poſſibly he can, <hi>the hope of heauenly ioyes and comforts,</hi> bringeth <hi>death</hi> before them, in as terrible and vgly ſhape as may be. Whereupon it commeth to paſſe, that men are ſo haled and drawne with affection on the one ſide, and ſo appaled with feare on the other, that nothing ſeemeth more lothſome and
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:12058:161"/>vnſauoury vnto their taſte, then the cup of Death. This being once brought to paſſe, and the enemy finding our deſire and affection to the ioyes of heauen, to be ſo dull and weake, and knowing alſo how fearefull the ſight of death is, euen to Gods Children, eſpecially at this laſt gaſpe, and cloſing vp of life, hee is then moſt buſie with them, to caſt in their way all ſuch motions, as poſſibly he can, to driue them (as I haue ſayd) into <hi>deſpaire.</hi> Heerupon it is, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dangerous and <hi>doubting</hi> motions, through this ſubtilty of <hi>Satan,</hi> doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe in their mindes, whether they bee of the number of <hi>Gods children,</hi> &amp; <hi>mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſts</hi> body or not, hauing ſuch vnſauoury fruits proceeding from them. Theſe <hi>thoughts</hi> ſometimes, in many of them, by the crafty working of the Enemy, become ſo forcible, that they are (as it were) continually thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring out words of maruellous great extremity, aſſirming indeede, that they are none of Gods ſeruants, haue no faith, no hope of ſaluation, and doe not appertaine to the Kingdome of God.
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:12058:161"/>And that, becauſe, for a time, they find their <hi>hearts</hi> to be, as it were, <hi>benummed</hi> and dull in the ſenſe and feeling of the heauenly and eternall comforts.</p>
               <p>As in other <hi>temptations</hi> of <hi>Satan</hi> wee haue labored both to lay open the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of the ſame, and to ſhew by what meanes they might bee auoyded, and haue alſo ſet downe ſuch comforts, whereby both the parties afflicted, and others alſo might bee ſtrengthened a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch aſſaults of the Enemy: So likewiſe I purpoſe, by the aſſiſtance of Gods Spirit, to doe in this temptation alſo; that ſo, the <hi>poyſon</hi> of <hi>Satans</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions being deſcryed, the dangers thereof may be the more eaſily auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. This therefore in this caſe, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth <hi>firſt</hi> to be obſerued, for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of the afflicted, both preſent, and which ſhall heereafter, through the ſubtilty of the Enemy, fall into ſuch danger; that theſe are no <hi>ſtrange</hi> and <hi>vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wonted</hi> things, but <hi>vſuall</hi> and <hi>common,</hi> and ſuch as haue and doe befall the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God.

                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 6.5.</note> For that <hi>In death there is no remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the Lord, and in the graue who ſhall praiſe him?</hi>

<pb n="307" facs="tcp:12058:162"/>of life, whereof hee is ſo deſirous. For euery thing is naturally giuen to ſhun and flee his contrary.

<pb n="308" facs="tcp:12058:163"/>being a thing ſo contrary to our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it would clearely appeare, that there would be found in them a certain feare &amp; vnwillingnes to die, which fear and vnwillingnes is ſo much the rather &amp; the more increaſed in them, when as it is in part attended with the <hi>cogitation</hi> or memory of thoſe things, wherein men in this life doe take any <hi>delight</hi> and <hi>pleaſure,</hi> and in part bereaued of the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of theſe exceeding comforts reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for vs in the life to come.</p>

He is not ignorant to take opportunity fitteſt for his purpoſe. And therefore, now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all other his deſired times, he will deuiſe, and ſound into the bottome of all his ſubtilties, to entrap and ſo to make conqueſt of the Chriſtian ſoules, knowing that this is the laſt <hi>combate</hi> that he is like to make with ſuch an one. If now he loſe, it is loſt for euer: If now he preuaile and ouercome, there is no recouery to bee hoped for afterward.

<pb n="310" facs="tcp:12058:164"/>muſt make full account, and looke to haue many foyles at <hi>Satans</hi> hands, that ſhall bring their faith, euen vpon her knees: which thing being once ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, no maruell if this ſubtill Satan, to the greater daunting of Gods Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, doe found out the triumph, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the victory gotten, caſting in their teeth their ſinnes paſt, and bringing to their remembrance their former wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe, and withall, putting them in minde ſometime of the delights and pleaſures of this world, that ſo by theſe &amp; ſuch like practices, he may the rather and the ſooner driue men into <hi>deſpaire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The caſe therefore of Chriſtians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo dangerous, it is good, that wee doe conſider what way is beſt for vs to take, to cut <hi>Satan</hi> ſhort of his purpoſe, and to auoyd the danger and perill of this finall conflict.</p>
               <p>One thing whereby <hi>Satan</hi> taketh ſo great aduantage, and ſo farre preuaileth with a great number of men, is, for that in the time of <hi>life</hi> and <hi>health,</hi> they neuer, or very little as they ſhould, <hi>bethinke</hi> themſelues of <hi>death:</hi> So that when the
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:12058:164"/>time and houre thereof, which is ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and vncertaine, doeth come vpon them, they go like men, naked and vnarmed into the field, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with this ſtrong and mightie Aduerſarie: And then it is no matuell, if they being ſo vnprouided and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed, and lying ſo open, do receiue many grieuous and deadly wounds.</p>
               <p>It is therefore very expedient and needefull for euery man, in time of <hi>health,</hi> to thinke of <hi>ſickeneſſe,</hi> and in time of <hi>life,</hi> to be mindfull of <hi>death,</hi> and continually to bee carefull that he may bee <hi>prepared</hi> for to die: for it is an vneuitable thing, it cannot bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoided, with all the power, policie, and cunning we can vſe.

When as I ſay it ſhould bee a daily <hi>preparation,</hi> I would be loth to bee miſtaken; I doe not meane ſuch a kind of preparation, as many of the
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:12058:165"/>great and mighty men of the world doe dreame of, when as either in their life time in their owne perſons; or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their death, by their Executors, or others put in truſt therewith, they are carefull, yea too carefull, to prouide that a <hi>Tombo</hi> bee ſet vp and builded to ſhrowde their bodies in, and that with moſt coſtly, curious, and cunning worke; but neuer once thinke of this which is moſt needfull; that is, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide a <hi>Receptacle</hi> for the ſoule: It may bee (as it doth appeare) that they thinke to die: ſo I beſeech the Lord, they may bee prepared to die in the Lord: ſo they ſhall bee ſure, howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuer the bodie ſpeed on earth for a time, yet at the laſt Day, both body and ſoule ſhall bee in bleſſed eſtate with <hi>Chriſt</hi> for euer, in <hi>heauen.</hi> This madneſſe of men, in preparing ſuch coſtly <hi>Tombes</hi> or <hi>Sepulchres,</hi> may very well bee accounted in the number of the <hi>vanities,</hi> and follies, wherewith the world is at this day ouer-flowed: for the coſt that is beſtowed on them, might a thouſand times bee better be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:12058:165"/>on the <hi>poore afflicted members of Chriſt,</hi> whereby ſome great gaine, by the laying forth thereof (if it bee done without hope of merit) would redound to the ſoule. The cunning workemanſhip is (indeed) matter ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for men to gaze vpon, then for any other good. When all is done, both for charge and cunning, in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vp, and beautifying of this thing ſo brauely, yet it is but a <hi>Caue</hi> for a rotten and corrupted carkaſe, beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for polluted bones, and carefully adorned for ſimple Gueſts, euen the crawling wormes, there to feed and gnaw vpon their ſeſtred and ſtinking fleſh. The ſoule is the principall part of man; let euery one apply himſelfe therefore principally to prouide, that it may bee harboured, protected and defended againſt the violence and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging ſtormes of <hi>Satans</hi> fury: Be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to prouide, that ſhee may bee ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med from top to toe, with the <hi>Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Armour,</hi> whereof S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh <hi>Ephe.</hi> 6. ſo ſhalt thou be in ſafety.<note place="margin">

               <pb n="318" facs="tcp:12058:168"/>
               <p>This was giuen in charge, euen from God himſelfe,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Kings</hi> 20.1.</note> vnto King <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah,</hi> by the Lords Prophet, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him to <hi>ſet his houſe in order: for hee muſt die.</hi> Experience in all ages, yea, and common ſenſe alſo, teacheth ſufficiently, how neceſſarie this kinde of <hi>preparation is,</hi> what great <hi>commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> haue growne, where the ſame hath beene daily vſed; and contrariwife, what great vexations, and troubles in Law, with a great number of other inconueniences, haue followed vpon the neglect thereof. So that hereby it eaſily appeareth, that this dutie can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee neglected, without great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie vnto thy ſeed and family, that ſhall ſucceed after thee; yea, this alſo take by the way, as a thing vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly true: That as the vtter neglect hereof, is thus hurtfull to thy <hi>ſeed</hi> and <hi>poſterity;</hi> ſo the deferring, and putting off the ſame (which is a very vſuall thing) is very hurtfull and dangerous vnto <hi>thy ſelfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore as it is requiſite, that we ſhould haue a care in our life time, to
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:12058:168"/>ſet all things ſtraight and in good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, both for the diſcharging of our ſelues of that heauy burden of theſe worldly cares, and alſo for the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing of peace and quietneſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thoſe which are deare vnto vs: whom we are to leaue to ſuruine vs, So wee muſt conſider, that the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall thing that wee are to remember in it, is, that it is indeed a preparation that belongeth not ſo much vnto the time of infirmitie and <hi>ſickeneſſe,</hi> as it doth vnto the time of <hi>health:</hi> And that it ought then doubtleſſe to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, when the Lord doth affoord vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to man, ſtrength of body and good memory, and ſhould not bee poſted ouer vnto the latter end, when ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, the meſſenger of death, ſhall bee ſent to call, or cite vs vnto <hi>Deaths</hi> Court. For vpon this paſſing and poſting ouer the matter, from the time of health vnto ſickeneſſe, and in ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe time, euen vnto the time almoſt when Death commeth to ſeyze vpon vs, it commeth to paſſe, that either the due order for the quiet eſtate of
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:12058:169"/>thy houſe, is, nor cannot be ſo well looked vnto, and prouided for as it ought; or that thy ſoule (which is moſt to bee lamented) in the time of thine agonies and ſickneſſes, is little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing regarded.</p>
               <p>But to eouer this vſuall fault, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring this godly action, from the time conuenient, vnto the time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed altogether inconuenient and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meet, <hi>Satan</hi> hath miniſtred a cloake of <hi>excuſe,</hi> where with many are won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully blinded, as though indeed God were bound of duty to order things after their preſcription, and to deale with them after their own hearts luſts. Tuſh, ſay they, I hope well, that God will giue mee time and ſpace to prouide for both theſe things; that is, both for the ſetting of mine houſe in order, and alſo for the good eſtate of my ſoule, and that hee will not take mee out of this world in ſuch a ſudden manner, but that I ſhall haue oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, and good time allowed mee to ſet all things ſtraight, both for the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly diſpoſition of my goods, and
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:12058:169"/>alſo for the carefull attending vpon the comforts, requiſite and needfull for the benefit and good of my ſoule.</p>
               <p>Beware, good Chriſtian brother and ſiſter, who euer thou art, that thus deceiueſt thy ſelfe, or rather yeeldeſt thy ſelfe to bee deceiued by <hi>Satan;</hi> this is the crafty perſwaſion of thine vtter and moſt malicious enemy, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is none otherwiſe to be eſteemed and iudged of, but as a moſt extreme folly, and point of dotage, that I may ſo call it, in this manner to dally with, and to abuſe the perſon of God: for GOD hath giuen vnto thee a great time for doing hereof, and thou neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecteſt it; it argueth therefore a great folly and madneſſe in thee. It is in the vſuall, and common <hi>Prouerbe, While the Pig is proffered, hold open the Poake:</hi> God doth of goodneſſe offer thee time, to effect both theſe godly acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: take it when it is offered, and reſt not thy ſelfe vpon vncertaine hope and expectation of the like againe heereafter. If thou didſt well conſider of the thing indeed, thou ſhouldſt ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:12058:170"/>find, that thou haſt very ſmall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to moue thee to hope after this time thou dream'ſt of, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as if it were longer then commonly is allotted vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any, yet it would bee found little enough to be imployed for the good &amp; benefit of thy ſoule. And why then ſhouldſt thou thinke, that God will bee thus gracious to beſtow this thing vpon thee, in a time that is <hi>moſt vnfit,</hi> when thou ſo vnthankefully didſt put off and neglect the ſame, being offered vnto thee ſo often be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in a time <hi>conuenient?</hi> Doe not thinke that thou haſt God at com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, take his offer with thankfulnes, &amp; vſe it as thou oughteſt, to his glory and thy good, and do not in any wiſe, preſume to preſcribe vnto him a time, or a manner how hee ſhall deale with thee at thine end. If thou marke well without flatterie of thy ſelfe, what thou haſt deſerued, thou haſt a great and a iuſt cauſe alſo to feare, leſt for thy careleſſe neglect of this, which in mercy hee offereth thee, in iuſtice hee ſtrike thee ſuddenly, and at vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares.
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:12058:170"/>If therefore I might giue <hi>counſell</hi> in this ſo dangerous a caſe, I would aduiſe euery childe of GOD, to lay aſide this vnchriſtian hope, and to <hi>renew his Teſtament yeerely,</hi> nay monethly, or oftner, that ſo he may be in a readineſſe when death commeth rather then to poſt off all to bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in the time of <hi>ſickneſſe:</hi> for by this deferring it commeth oftentimes to paſſe (which is a lamentable thing for euery Chriſtian heart and eye, to thinke vpon and ſee) that the man preſſed with ſickeneſſe, and lying (as yee would ſay) at the point of, death, when hee ſhould haue his heart and minde wholly ſet and fixed on heauen and heauenly things, is ſo clogged and fettered in the cares of this life, and ſuch as concerne his houſe and Family, that though his <hi>will</hi> be made according to his meaning, his goods ordered and diſpoſed accordingly, and all things finiſhed and ended, to the knowledge of men, yet with this ſick man himſelfe it is not ſo fully diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched, but that theſe worldly
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:12058:171"/>affaires, wherewith his head hath been thus of late buſied, wil not ſo be rooted out, but that a man ſhall heare him often, euen in his greateſt ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, to mutter and to talke of nothing elſe but theſe, as though his head and thoughts were bent vpon nothing elſe. And this many do with ſuch ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemencie and earneſtneſſe, that thereby they giue occaſion vnto ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that heare them, to iudge, that not onely the taſte and feeling, but alſo the very thought and inward me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation of heauenly ioyes and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, ſeeme (for the time) to bee barred and excluded from hauing any place of reſt and harbour in his heart and ſoule.</p>
               <p>Wherefore if thou wilt not bee hindred from this taſte of heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ioyes and pleaſures, at thy death and end of this thy naturall life: haue a care in <hi>health,</hi> in this ſort to prouide for <hi>death,</hi> leſt the cares of this life, bee a cauſe to hold and keepe theſe endleſſe comforts from thee.

While thou art yet ſound and luſtie, haue thy Sc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre in a readineſſe, with <hi>Ioſeph of Arimathea,</hi> that is, let all things be prouided, and ſet in ſuch a readineſſe, as though alwayes, and euery houre, thou wert prepared, and readie to deſcend into the graue. Let neither thy <hi>youthfull yeeres,</hi> nor yet thy <hi>ſtrength</hi> flatter thee, (two deceitfull baites to breed ſecuritie) as though thou hadſt long to liue, and mightſt continue yet many yeeres, and ſo thou put off the time, to make this preparation: But while it is to day, while thou haſt time and ſeaſon, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre it not, but accept and vſe well the time that God hath offered, and giuen vnto thee.</p>

               <p>Now that according to that which I haue ſaid, we may bee throughly and ſtrongly armed, I thinke it good, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> hath left vnto vs the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the <hi>Panoplyo</hi> and complete <hi>armour</hi> of a Chriſtian, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer the ſame in the ſeuerall parts, that ſo the vſe of euery piece may ſtand vs in the better ſtead, and ſerue our turnes the better in this conflict.</p>
               <p>Firſt therefore,<note place="margin">1. Coat of Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.</note> according to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles counſell, thou art to put on the <hi>Coat of conſtancie.</hi> For that it is which the Apoſtle meaneth,<note place="margin">

When thou art to enter into this fight, all feare, all fainting muſt be vtterly exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and baniſhed from thee: although thine enemies will vſe many meanes, to beate a feare into thee, and to make thee to ſhrinke and flie away, yet thou muſt haue a care vnto this, to ſtand faſt. But herein thou art to looke well vnto the matter, and take a good view of this
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:12058:174"/>piece of <hi>armour:</hi> I meane, this <hi>Coat of Conſtancie,</hi> leſt thou be deceiued.

Except thy <hi>conſtancie</hi> and courage then be in the Lord, thou wilt eaſily bee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowne, thou art not able to ſtand. Thou muſt, therefore, when thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt to occupy a roome in this fight (which thou muſt doe euen all thy whole life time) vtterly forſake thine owne wit and policy, thine abundance and wealth, all truſt and confidence in thine owne workes and merits. How ſure ſoeuer theſe things appeare and be iudged of ſome: yet they are found meere weake, and inſufficient of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, in the iudgement of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> whoſe iudgement thou art aboue all to ſtand to, approoue and like of.
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:12058:175"/>Learne therefore to bee bold and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, againſt the rage of thy furious e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies; not becauſe thou haſt naturall ſtrength, or worldly wit and policie, or the riches and goods of the world; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for that thou art attended vpon with many <hi>Popiſh ceremonies,</hi> which are worſe then vanities; or becauſe thou haſt ſome ſtore of good workes: But be thou therefore ſtrong, and ſtand it out with <hi>conſtancie,</hi> becauſe the Lord is with thee.

For it is not generally all truths, neither that which man wil pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuouſly obtrude and thruſt vpon thee for truth, (Of which ſort are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all the <hi>Popiſh</hi> points of Religion, beautified with the vaine ſhew of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny vaine and idle <hi>ceremonies</hi>) But it is onely the <hi>Truth</hi> and ſinceritie of the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> which the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of.

<pb n="334" facs="tcp:12058:176"/>of our naturall and fleſhly reaſon, which would otherwiſe greatly trouble and hinder vs in this <hi>Spirituall</hi> combate.

And although it be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo needfull, yet alas, how ſmall is the number of thoſe which are carefull to prouide themſelues of it! For euen in theſe golden dayes of peace and ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from perſecution, when as the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell by the preaching thereof, is offered vnto men in moſt plenteous manner, it is a world to ſee, how diuerſly men are affected towards it, &amp; that in the worſt manner. Some giue themſelues whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnto the world: ſome follow the pleaſures of the fleſh: ſome, although they haue taſted and felt the great fauor of God, in deliuering them from the palpable darknes of <hi>Romiſh</hi> ſuperſtition and Idolatry: yet now, lothing the ſweet <hi>Manna</hi> of the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> like the rebellious and murmuring <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> in their hearts; returne back againe vnto the fleſh-pots of <hi>Aegypt.</hi> And almoſt
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:12058:176"/>generally it is to be found in men, that euery thing of light moment and weight; yet is of force ſufficient, to hold them from prepating of this <hi>gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,</hi> whereby no ſmall aduantage is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to our deadly Enemy, to preuaile againſt vs.</p>
               <p>The <hi>third</hi> piece of Armour to helpe to defend vs in this fight,<note place="margin">3.

And it is againe on the other part a lamentable thing to ſee, how careleſſely men are for the moſt part affected, and how ſlacke they are in preparing this piece of Armour, thinking in themſelues, all to be well and ſafe enough, although they haue liued neuer ſo lewdly and diſſolutely, and neglected the putting on of this piece of Armour, euen to the very inſtant and time of death; think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing if then they can <hi>repent,</hi> there is no more adoe.

For <hi>Satan,</hi> as hath beene ſhewed before, hath many temptations, which in his owne ſenſe and ſort he vſeth to ground vpon the written Word, which temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations can by no meanes better bee auoided, then by the ſame Word, vſed in the true and right ſenſe thereof. This can hardly or neuer bee done, vnleſſe thou be skilfull and expert in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.

For this indeed is a time, wherin the chiefeſt loue that thou canſt ſhew vnto thy brother and deareſt friend, is to labour by all meanes, to arme him with patience againſt the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of death, to draw him from the
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:12058:181"/>loue of the world, and to breed in him a loue &amp; a liking vnto heauenly things, in miniſtring as ſpirituall and heauenly comfort as thou canſt, vnto his ſoule, and not to be ouer-<hi>nice</hi> herein &amp; dianty of thy paines as many are, which are loth to make <hi>any mention</hi> of death at all vnto the perſon diſeaſed, leſt it ſhould bring or breed any <hi>diſcomfort</hi> vnto his ſick friend. And ſo for feare of the loſſe of a little <hi>worldly comfort,</hi> which is but vanity, thou wilt depriue him of this <hi>ſpirituall comfort</hi> belonging to his ſoule. It is good (I confeſſe) to bee carefull for the good of his <hi>body:</hi> but it is far better, and a greater argument and ſigne of true loue in thee, to be carefull for the good of his <hi>ſoule.</hi>

               <p>Among theſe that thus art attendant at or in the time of ſicknes, the <hi>Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> alſo oftentimes hath his place. Of whom wee might ſpeake concerning many points, if that our Treaty were <hi>generally</hi> reſpecting death; and not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly tyed vnto it, as it is attended with ſuch a dangerous conflict, with ſo great and mighty enemies.

               <p>Thou haſt all thy life time beene in the <hi>field</hi> (for a Chriſtian mans life is a continuall <hi>warfare,</hi> wherein he lyeth in continuall <hi>leager</hi> againſt the Diuell.)

               <argument>
                  <p>That the Elect in time bee aſſured of their election and how.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe proofe and demonſtration of this <hi>poſition,</hi> (namely, that the <hi>Elect and Choſen of God in time bee aſſured of their election</hi>) I thought conuenient to be annexed vnto this treatiſe, becauſe it ſerueth not a little, to miniſter help and comfort, for the allaying and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of the troubles and diſcomforts of the afflicted ſoule. And becauſe it is of many made a doubt &amp; <hi>queſtion,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any ſuch aſſurance may be at all in Gods Children, except it bee onely by ſpeciall reuelation, I thought it good, for the better vnderſtanding of the ſame, briefly to premiſe ſomething of the meaning heereof, and to ſhew how it is to be vnderſtood.</p>
               <p>Firſt therefore, when I ſay the <hi>Elect,</hi> I doe <hi>not</hi> meane <hi>ſome,</hi> but <hi>all,</hi> and <hi>euerie one of the Elect of God,</hi> that they may, and ſhall haue a certainty and an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:12058:185"/>that they are elect vnto ſaluation. But for further and better explanation of my meaning, I adde to this mine aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, <hi>(in time)</hi> for it is <hi>not alwayes</hi> ſo, but <hi>after ſuch time onely, as they are effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually called and regenerated,</hi> and that before ſuch time they cannot haue it So that this is not any ſpeciall and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>reuelation,</hi> but a thing common and incident, euen <hi>generally to all,</hi> and <hi>particularly to euery one</hi> after that hee is thus thorowly called and renewed, to know and bee aſſured, that not onely generally all that doe belieue in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> are elect, and ſhall bee ſaued, but alſo himſelfe in ſeuerall and particular, to be one of the number of thoſe whom God, in his eternall and euerlaſting de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree and purpoſe, hath predeſtinate and appoynted vnto life. The certainty of which doctrine ſhall plainely appeare, and bee fully demonſtrated, in ſetting downe the <hi>meanes,</hi> how this aſſurance is wrought and effected in them. For proofe of this ſo profitable a poynt of doctrine, let vs ſee ſo briefly and ſo plainely as we can, by what <hi>reaſons</hi> it
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:12058:186"/>may bee prooued, that the man regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate may be certified and aſſured of his Election.</p>
               <p>The <hi>firſt argument</hi> of this aſſurance,<note place="margin">1. Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of aſſurance of Electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> is drawne and brought from the <hi>eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of their owne Spirit,</hi> which the faithfull finde within themſelues. For that this, I meane <hi>the Spirit of euery one of the Elect of God,</hi> is a very good wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to giue euidence &amp; teſtimony in this caſe, as the Apoſtle plainly teacheth, <hi>Ro.</hi> 8. where he hath theſe words, that <hi>the Spirit of God beareth witnes with our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16.</note> So that if both do witnes together, then our Spirit doth witnes alſo. And this is that teſtimony, which euery man by his own Spirit and conſcience doth deriue &amp; draw from thoſe <hi>generall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions,</hi> which he findeth in the <hi>Goſpel:</hi> for from the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> the Spirit of euery one of the Elect of God doth fetch his <hi>euidence,</hi> by <hi>applying</hi> the ſame, and by annexing an aſſumption vnto the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall doctrine and vniuerſall propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons there deliuered. As for <hi>example,</hi> The Goſpel teacheth, that <hi>euery one that belieueth in Chriſt, ſhall ſaued.</hi> This <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:12058:186"/>propoſition</hi> wanteth not good proofe, but hath very many places in the Scriptures to confirme the ſame. <hi>They that haue faith, and doe belieue,</hi>

<pb n="356" facs="tcp:12058:187"/>God.

               </p>
               <p>Whereunto I <hi>anſwer,</hi> that although wee cannot iudge and diſcerne of the things of God, either concerning his excellent nature, or the myſtery of his will, in the wayes of life and ſaluation, what and how it ſhall bee, but by the Spirit, reuealing and manifeſting the ſame in the ſacred Scriptures, by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery of his Prophets and Apoſtles: yet the <hi>knowledge</hi> of theſe things being had, it hindreth not, but that <hi>by our own Spirit,</hi> wee may <hi>iudge</hi> the preſence of

                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.13, 14.</note> becauſe it doth <hi>approoue</hi> vnto vs our <hi>Adoption,</hi> that we are ſingled out from the world, and by grace in <hi>Chriſt adopted</hi> to be the ſons of God. And this ſo fully and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, that it maketh vs confidently and boldly to cry and call vpon God, by the name of <hi>Father.</hi> It is called <hi>the Spirit
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:12058:189"/>of Promiſe,</hi> becauſe it <hi>ſealeth</hi> vnto our hearts the vſe of all Gods <hi>promiſes</hi> in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> contained at large in the Goſpell, to bee our owne, and to appertaine and belong vnto vs. And it is called the <hi>Earneſt of our Inheritance,</hi> for that it is as a <hi>Pledge</hi> and <hi>Pawne</hi> vnto vs, whereby wee are aſſured, that God will perfect and performe his <hi>couenant</hi> of life in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that hee hath made, and inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with vs, that are his faithfull Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>

<pb n="361" facs="tcp:12058:189"/>and that wee are by this part, as by an earneſt penny <hi>aſſured,</hi> that God, in his time appointed, will bring this worke in vs vnto <hi>perfection,</hi> for that he is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and iuſt of his promiſe, and will not let paſſe this good worke, which hee hath thus begun in vs, but will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and performe it, vntill the day of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> yet in that the Spirit is ſayd thus to witneſſe, and to ſeale vnto vs, the very words doe ſufficiently intimate a further thing then the Spirit it ſelfe. For it is certaine, that theſe are things euen in common ſpeech and reaſon <hi>diſtinct</hi> and <hi>differing</hi> one from another, the <hi>te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony</hi> or <hi>witneſſe,</hi> and the <hi>perſon witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing</hi> the <hi>ſealing</hi> and <hi>impreſsion of the ſeale,</hi> and the <hi>ſeale it ſelfe.</hi>

               <p>This <hi>teſtimony,</hi> and <hi>print or impreſsion</hi> of the Spirit, I take <hi>not</hi> to be <hi>diuers,</hi> but to be one and the ſelfe ſame thing, and doe iudge it to be nothing els, but the <hi>reparation or a new impreſsion of the image of God in vs,</hi> which was before cancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and defaced in vs, by reaſon of the fall of <hi>Adam.</hi> So that, when the <hi>Spirit</hi> is thus ſayd to <hi>ſeale,</hi> nothing els is
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:12058:190"/>meant therby, but that it doth again <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtamp,</hi> and ingraue and ſet vpon vs, euen vpon our hearts and ſoules, that <hi>Image of goodneſſe, purity, holineſſe, wiſdome, ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity, truth</hi> and <hi>loue that is of God.</hi> For this is the very ſtamp of the Spirit, which otherwiſe, in other places, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led our <hi>Regeneration,</hi> and this is the <hi>te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony</hi> and <hi>witneſſe</hi> that it giueth.</p>
               <p>Wherefore that wee may now the better ſee and vnderſtand, how this <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> in this ſort doth <hi>witneſſe,</hi> and <hi>giue testimony</hi> with <hi>our Spirits,</hi> of nor adoption into the number and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip of the children of God, I think it good, that we proceed a little further, in the Apoſtles ſimilitude. This <hi>phraſe</hi> and manner of ſpeaking, is drawn from the manner of men, vſed for confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>contracts</hi> and bargaines made, who hauing in ſpeech concluded vpon their couenants, ſtraightway cauſe the ſame to bee firſt <hi>written</hi> and ingroſſed, and after their <hi>ſeales</hi> to bee to the ſame annexed, to <hi>witneſſe</hi> and aſſure, both the truth of the bargaine, and alſo the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance thereof: So that the very

                  <hi>print</hi> and impreſſion abiding ſtill in the <hi>wax,</hi> is a ſufficient witneſſe, that thoſe writings are his act and deede, whoſe ſeale is there annexed, and that therfore alſo he will in truth ſurely <hi>performe</hi> the couenants therein contained. Now for a further explanation hereof, and to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply this, according to the ſeuerall cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances to our preſent purpoſe, it is diligently to bee obſerued and noted, that the couenants or matter of the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings betwixt God and his Children, are the <hi>promiſes</hi> of Grace, in <hi>Chriſt</hi> through <hi>faith,</hi> compriſed in the Goſpel. Theſe ſayd <hi>promiſes</hi> are <hi>written</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſed in the tables of euery faithfull mans <hi>heart,</hi> according to that ſaying, <hi>I will write my lawes in their hearts.</hi>

Whereupon, as is aforeſayd our heart and conſcience doth witneſſe to vs, that they doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long vnto vs, and that we are the ſonnes of God. Then together with this alſo, commeth the <hi>ſeale</hi> and <hi>witneſſe</hi> of the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> bearing witneſſe, as I haue ſayd, with our <hi>Spirit</hi> alſo, of the
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:12058:191"/>truth heereof, by ſetting his ſtamp and ſeale vpon our ſoules and harts, wherin, as in tables, theſe couenants were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, confirming moſt effectually, and aſſuring vs, that wee are indeede of the number of thoſe in whom theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes ſhall be fulfilled, that we are elect of God, and ſuch as are ordained vnto eternall life, becauſe this image and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the Spirit is giuen and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted vnto none, but thoſe onely, that are in the number of Gods adopted children. See therefore (I pray thee) now, in what <hi>manner</hi> the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> doth <hi>witneſſe</hi> and <hi>ſeale</hi> vnto thee, that <hi>thou</hi> art one of Gods <hi>Elect;</hi> euen by ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting &amp; ingrauing vpon vs <hi>ſuch a ſtamp,</hi> marke and impreſſion, as is <hi>onely proper</hi> and pecuilar vnto thoſe that ſhall bee ſaued.

And therefore it is likely (ſay the framers of this Obiection) that notwithſtanding theſe <hi>markes,</hi> the <hi>Elect</hi> of God may be <hi>deceiued,</hi> in iudging that hee hath them, when as it is but in ſhew onely, and not (as it ought to be) in deed and truth.</p>

<pb n="372" facs="tcp:12058:195"/>againe</hi> from grace, and haue <hi>no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainety</hi> of their perſeuerance and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance vntill the end.</p>
               <p>Both theſe <hi>Obiections</hi> wee haue in part touched before, vpon occaſions offered in our diſcourſe, and handling of the ſeuerall temptations, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſhalbe at this time the ſhorter.</p>
               <p>Concerning the <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe two Obiections, be it anſwered, that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer the <hi>hypocrites</hi> are oftentimes <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued</hi> with counterfeit ſhewes and ſhadowes, becauſe they are giuen to <hi>flatter</hi> themſelues with euery light ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of things, without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in quirie, as ayming eſpecially at their owne glorie and praiſe: yet with the <hi>Elect</hi> of God it is <hi>not ſo.</hi>

But what of that? When they haue done all that they can, tryed and examined things to the vttermoſt, may they not bee ſtill <hi>deceiued?</hi> When they haue found,
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:12058:195"/>that they haue a <hi>faith,</hi> may they not bee <hi>deceiued,</hi> in iudging whether it be the <hi>true faith or no?</hi> When they haue found the preſence of the Spirit in them, can they make a liuely <hi>difference,</hi> to know whether it bee that Spirit of Adoption or not? For it is apparant, that the <hi>Reprobates</hi> alſo (in ſome ſort) may bee <hi>partakers</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> And when the Elect haue well aduiſed them of their <hi>workes,</hi> doe ſee their fruits, and that to their great good li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, can they certainely tell, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſame their workes bee <hi>true effects</hi> of true ſanctification, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they bee <hi>fained</hi> and <hi>hypocriticall,</hi> ſeeing that hypocrites alſo may doe thus much as well as they?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>The nature of true faith</hi> is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>know Chriſt,</hi>

<pb n="393" facs="tcp:12058:205"/>for that was in regard of vs a <hi>paſsiue loue,</hi> beeing the Loue God whereby hee loueth vs. But <hi>this loue,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of wee now ſpeake, is <hi>actiue</hi> in regard of our <hi>ſelues,</hi> euen that <hi>loue</hi> which we extend <hi>to others:</hi>

                     <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6.</note> for <hi>faith worketh by loue:</hi> ſo that if thou haſt a liuing and a working Faith, thou ſhalt alſo haue a <hi>loue</hi> attending on it, for elſe it cannot worke at all.</p>
               <p>Now this <hi>loue,</hi> in regard of the <hi>double obiect,</hi> is found to bee of <hi>two ſorts:</hi> that is, the loue which wee owe <hi>vnto God,</hi> principally and aboue all: and <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> the loue which we owe &amp; ought to beare <hi>towards our neighbour.</hi> And theſe <hi>two</hi> kindes of loue, although they greatly <hi>differ</hi> the one from the other; yet they are alwayes ſo <hi>linked,</hi> and inſeparably coupled and tyed together, that they cannot in any wiſe bee <hi>parted</hi> or ſeuered the one from the other. <hi>For how can he,</hi> ſaith <hi>Iohn,</hi>

                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1.</note> For <hi>there is no condemnation to them that walke not after the fleſh, but after the Spirit.</hi> And who are they, that ſhall thus be <hi>ſaued,</hi> and ſhall not enter into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation,

               <argument>
                  <p>How the faithfull ſhall know that they haue the Spirit of Adoption.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THeſe things being in this manner ſet downe, for the better quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the troubled conſcience, it now remaineth, that as we haue oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupyed our ſelues in poynting out the markes of a true &amp; liuely faith, ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we take ſome paines, to ſyft out and try alſo, how the ſeruants of God, his faithfull and elect children, may <hi>diſcerne</hi> and know, that they <hi>haue</hi> that <hi>teſtifying Spirit of Adoption,</hi> whereof the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16. that giueth that plaine and euident teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie vnto their ſpirits, that they are the ſons of God. For the wicked and reprobates, in ſome ſort, may be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the Holy Ghoſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſeemeth that the Elect, in this point, may bee eaſily deceiued, and miſtake this their witneſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Two things,</hi> here by the way, wee
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:12058:208"/>muſt take good heed of.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Reprobates, as I haue ſaid, may in ſome ſort bee partakers of the Holy Ghoſt, and as ſhall bee after more plainly ſhewed, yet that we do not ſuppoſe or thinke, that they can in any wiſe bee partakers of the ſame holy Spirit, <hi>as it is the Spirit of Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> For in this manner and in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect it is imparted to the <hi>Elect</hi> of God <hi>onely,</hi> and to none other; For <hi>as many as are led by this Spirit,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.14.2.</note> 
                  <hi>they are the ſonnes of God.</hi> Secondly, that wee do not imagine this Spirit of Adoption, to be diſtinct in ſubſtance and eſſence, from that whereof the wicked are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers, as though it had a diuers na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but that the <hi>onely difference</hi> is in the <hi>manner of operation;</hi> or to ſpeake more plainely, in the <hi>manner of diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting,</hi> and diuiding his gifts amongſt men. And according to this operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or diſtribution, there are <hi>diuers names</hi> aſcribed vnto him in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and yet the Spirit is but one and the ſame ſtill. As for an <hi>example,</hi> when this Spirit <hi>effecteth wiſedome</hi> in any, it
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:12058:208"/>is called the <hi>Spirit of Wiſedome;</hi> when hee doth <hi>effect peace and ioy,</hi> hee is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Spirit of peace and ioy.</hi> When hee worketh this witneſſe of <hi>Adoption</hi> in any, it is called the <hi>Spirit of Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> And on the other part, when hee putteth <hi>feare</hi> and terrour into any, hee is called the <hi>Spirit of bondage.</hi> The truth hereof is proued by the words of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> affirming that <hi>there are diner ſities of gifts,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.8, &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>but the ſame Spirit:</hi> For, <hi>to one is giuen, by the Spirit, the word of wiſedome, and to another the word of knowledge, by the ſame Spirit; and to another, is giuen faith, by the ſame Spirit; and to another, the gifts of healing, by the ſame Spirit, and to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the operations of great workes; and to another Prophecie, and to another the diſcerning of Spirits, and to another di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſities of tongues, and to another the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of tongues: and all theſe things, worketh euen the ſelfe ſame Spirit, diſtributing to euery man ſeuerally as hee will.</hi> So that in <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>eſſence</hi> it is <hi>the ſame</hi> Spirit that worketh in the diſtribution of all theſe gifts, both to
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:12058:209"/>the Elect and alſo Reprobates, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the <hi>perſons</hi> in whom hee wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, bee (as I haue ſaid) found to be <hi>diuers.</hi> Seeing then that the caſe ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth ſo, that euen the Reprobates are partakers of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> in that the gifts of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> in ſome part, are giuen and imparted vnto them; I thinke it very expedient, for the remouing of all doubts which may ariſe, concerning this mine aſſertion: <hi>Firſt,</hi> to ſhew, <hi>in what manner</hi> this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit <hi>is,</hi> and doth thus diuerſly <hi>worke</hi> in the one, and in the other, in the Elect and in the Reprobate: And <hi>ſeeondly,</hi> what are the <hi>true markes</hi> and tokens, whereby the Spirit of Adoption may bee diſcerned.</p>
               <p>As touching the <hi>firſt,</hi> it is be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that the <hi>Spirit</hi> being in <hi>eſſence very God,</hi> and therefore infinite, and incomprehenſible, cannot be ſaid to be contained in any thing, but filleth heauen &amp; earth: And therefore, when it is ſaid, that hee is in any, it is to be vnderſtood, that hee is in them <hi>by his working and operation:</hi> And this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:12058:209"/>of his <hi>being</hi> in them, is after <hi>two ſorts,</hi> either <hi>naturall</hi> or elſe <hi>ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall. Naturall</hi> I call that, which exceedeth not the courſe and reach of mans nature: And this is ſuch as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth and concerncth the <hi>beeing</hi> onely; and in this ſenſe, the Spirit may bee ſaid to bee in the very <hi>ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe</hi> creatures, and to haue his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and operation in them. For by this Spirit of God it is, that euery thing is and hath his being, and by the ſame Spirit it is preſerued and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. Or elſe it is ſuch as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth things <hi>ſenſible,</hi> and indued with <hi>life ſenſe</hi> and <hi>motion,</hi> and thus it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted vnto the very dumbe and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable creatures; For euen vnto theſe it is that GOD giueth life and maintenance, and that by his Spirit, effectually working and performing all things; according to that of the <hi>Pſalmiſt, Thou ſendeſt forth thy Spirit. and they were created, and thou reneweſt the face of the earth.</hi> Or elſe it is ſuch as concerneth things indued with <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, life, ſenſe,</hi> and <hi>reaſon;</hi> and thus
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:12058:210"/>hee is in <hi>man,</hi> in a <hi>more perfect manner</hi> then in the former, working in him the gifts of nature, as ſenſe, reaſon, vnderſtanding, and ſuch like. And in this ſenſe, <hi>euery</hi> man liuing may bee ſaid to haue the Spirit of God, becauſe hee hath it in one ſort or other, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſome one or other of theſe natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall gifts in him. The <hi>ſecond</hi> way is <hi>ſupernaturall,</hi> that is, when the Spirit worketh beyond nature, and ſuch things as are not incident vnto the common nature of man: And theſe are ſuch as reſpect and concerne the <hi>knowledge of himſelfe,</hi> which fleſh and bloud, in her ordinary reach and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, could neuer come or attaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; and therefore I doe call this a <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall</hi> kinde of working. Which although it be in ſome ſort found in many of the <hi>Reprobates,</hi> yet was it not generally in all, all were not parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of it: For it is manifeſt, that many of them haue deceaſed, onely in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, without any further light of this true knowledge, which is reuealed in the Scriptures, which were for a long
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:12058:210"/>time detained and holden from the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and at this day cannot bee ſuffered in many Kingdomes of the world. This <hi>ſupernaturall</hi> kinde of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, is of <hi>two ſorts</hi> alſo. <hi>Firſt,</hi> by <hi>illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,</hi> and inlightning of the minde with knowledge and vnderſtanding of the Myſteries of life and ſaluation, whereby the minde is taught and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, and thereby indued with a knowledge of the Word of life, the <hi>Law</hi> and the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> and the ſeuerall points therein contained. <hi>Secondly,</hi> by <hi>Regeneration</hi> and <hi>Sanctiſication,</hi> as an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall fruit of the former knowledge and vnderſtanding.</p>
               <p>Now for reſolution of this doubt, concerning the <hi>Reprobates</hi> hauing of the Spirit of God, it is to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that they haue it, not onely in that <hi>naturall</hi> ſort, but alſo euen in this <hi>ſupernaturall</hi> order, working in them. For they are often <hi>illuminated</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened</hi> with the <hi>knowledge</hi> of God; they are often <hi>inſtructed</hi> in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Scriptures, both the <hi>Law</hi> and the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> inſomuch, that they
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:12058:211"/>can <hi>Preach</hi> and <hi>Prophecie</hi> in the name of <hi>Chriſt,</hi>

                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15.</note> Or elſe if it bee any conceit of <hi>ioy,</hi> yet it is but ſome ſudden and vncertaine flaſh, quickly <hi>appearing,</hi> and as quickly <hi>vaniſhing</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way againe, as is before declared. But as for the <hi>Spirit of Sanctification,</hi> and <hi>Regeneration,</hi> the Reprobates can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer bee partakers of; this kinde of working of the Spirit is neuer found in them, it is onely proper and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar vnto the Choſen and Elect of God.

<pb n="405" facs="tcp:12058:211"/>Spirit of God. For the reſolution of this doubt, let this ſuffice. It commeth next to bee conſidered of the true <hi>markes</hi> whereby this <hi>Spirit of Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> may bee <hi>diſcerned</hi> and knowne, how the Elect may know this Spirit of Adoption to bee in them, and that witneſſe and teſtimony that they feele in <hi>them,</hi> to bee the true teſtimony and witneſſe of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi>

<pb n="410" facs="tcp:12058:214"/>in the number of GODS Elect, but cannot grow indeed to any <hi>continuall</hi> or <hi>certaine reſolution</hi> therein. But this <hi>Spirit,</hi> if it haue <hi>liberty to ſpeake,</hi> and be <hi>attentiuely hearkened</hi> vnto, yeeldeth forth a full, and a <hi>ſettled perſwaſion</hi> of the truth of our <hi>Election in Chriſt,</hi> I ſay, if it haue <hi>liberty to ſpeake,</hi> and be <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiuely heard;</hi> for that it oftentimes falleth out with the faithfull, that though they haue this certaine Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe within them, yet the <hi>Fleſh</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time getting the head and maſtry ouer the <hi>Spirit</hi> in them, will <hi>not ſuffer</hi> it to <hi>ſpeake</hi> ſo plainely as it would. And they alſo, being thereupon trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with this frailty which they finde in themſelues, do often fall into ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wauering and doubting thoughts, while they do <hi>not liſten attentiuely</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this witneſſe of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> that now ſeemeth to ſpeake more coldly, and with a lower, and leſſe audible voice vnto their ſoules, then heretofore. For certaine it is, that though the <hi>Spirit</hi> doth alwaies witneſſe, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth alſo a moſt certaine and conſtant
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:12058:214"/>Witneſſe, for it is the Spirit of Truth; yet it is not alwaies in the <hi>like meaſure,</hi> to the diſcerning of our ſoules, but <hi>ſometime more euidently,</hi> and <hi>ſometime leſſe;</hi> yea, and that ſometime alſo ſo obſcurely, as that the children of God, whiles they are too much bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied otherwaies, in hearkening vnto the ſuggeſtions of <hi>Satan,</hi> the <hi>World,</hi> and the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> they doe ſeeme, as though they heard it <hi>not at all.</hi> Wherefore, if thou haſt once felt and found this teſtimony of the Spirit in thee, let it ſuffice thee, and be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with content, his teſtimony once gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, is of great force, for that (as I haue ſaid) hee cannot lye: Therefore I ſay, <hi>if at any time</hi> it hath <hi>witneſſed</hi> the ſame vnto thee, <hi>ſeale</hi> it vp for a moſt certaine truth: For the Spirit of God, which leadeth vs to all truth, ſpeaketh nothing but Truth, hath ſpoken it. And although now it ſeeme to waxe ſo cold, in giuing euidence, yet if it doe but <hi>whiſper;</hi> nay, if it doe (as you would ſay) but <hi>breathe</hi> within thee, that is, giue neuer ſo

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, in the <hi>manner</hi> alſo of <hi>the effecting</hi> this certaine Witneſſe and Teſtimonie, thou maiſt diſcerne it to bee the teſtimonie of this <hi>Spirit of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation and Adoption:</hi> for it is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and fully in the Death and Paſſion of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> euen by <hi>by aſſuring thy ſoule and conſcience, that Chriſt, with all his benefits, is thine,</hi> and that in and through him, and him alone, thou art become the adopted Childe of God, and heire of euerlaſting glorie. Now whereas by thy <hi>queſtion</hi> moued, thou ſeemeſt to doubt of the <hi>truth of this teſtimony,</hi> whether it bee of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> or not: I <hi>anſwer</hi> further, Is it any thing
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:12058:215"/>likely, that <hi>Satan</hi> would euer <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade</hi> any man of this <hi>aſſurance</hi> of ſuch incomparable benefits, as <hi>Chriſt</hi> by his Death hath purchaſed for his Elect? Would he euer <hi>perſwade</hi> men, that in <hi>Chriſt</hi> we are made the adopted Children of God? No, I aſſure you that is farre from Satans purpoſe: he knoweth that this kinde of doctrine ſerueth not to aduance, but vtterly to ouerthrow his kingdome; and therefore laboureth, what he may, to ſuppreſſe the publike preaching of the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> that this kind of doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine ſhould bee hid from the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of men; ſo farre is he off from furthering of the inward application of the ſame, vnto the comfort of our ſoules, wherein the vertue of <hi>Chriſt</hi> his death conſiſteth. Therefore if at any time the hypocrites do flatter and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade themſelues in their election, it is not wholly, alone and principally in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> &amp; from his death &amp; Paſſion, that this perſwaſion ariſeth, but vpon ſome other good liking &amp; cockering affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that they haue vnto their fayned

               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>HYpocrites</hi> aſwell as the <hi>Regenerate,</hi> haue in outward ſhew, many <hi>good deeds,</hi> wherby they gaine to themſelues no ſmall praiſe and commendation of deuotion and holineſſe, as appeareth by the ſect of the <hi>Phariſes.</hi> And therefore it ſeemeth, that in this reaſon, brought of the outward fruits of Regeneration, and in this argument of their election, the faithfull may conclude amiſſe. To this I <hi>anſwer</hi> no, in no wiſe. For not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this likelyhood bewixt their workes, yet there are vndoubted
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:12058:217"/>differences, whereby the man truely renewed and regenerate, doth and may diſcerne his deeds from thoſe of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites. For further and better proofe whereof, it is well to be obſerued, that there are <hi>three</hi> things, wherein the <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi> man may make and put a <hi>difference</hi> betwixt thoſe <hi>good workes</hi> which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede from himſelfe, and thoſe that are found in <hi>hypocrites.</hi> 1. the <hi>matter.</hi> 2. the <hi>forme</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> of them. And 3. the <hi>end</hi> wherunto they are directed.</p>
               <p>Firſt, concerning the <hi>matter,</hi> although not all, yet many of their workes by it are diſtinguiſhed. For the good <hi>workes</hi> of the man <hi>regenerate,</hi> doe fetch their ground and warrant from the <hi>Word of God,</hi> and are ſuch deedes and actions as God hath commanded: But the <hi>workes</hi> of <hi>hypocrites,</hi> contrary wiſe, are ſuch, for the moſt part, as are inuented and <hi>deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by men,</hi> hauing no ground nor war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for them in the Scriptures. Of the which ſort are very many in <hi>Popery,</hi> namely, their <hi>diriges, trentals, maſſes, pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimages, ſhrifts, ſuperſtitious faſtings</hi> and a great number moe of the ſame
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:12058:217"/>kinde, which are all the doctrines of men, and not of God: And therefore vtterly diſliked or rather condemned in the ſight of God. So that although the authors and inuentors hereof flattering themſelues in their blindneſſe, were perſwaded, that they did heerein <hi>a good worke,</hi> in obtruding theſe and ſuch like vpon the blinde and ignorant people: And the people alſo were in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner perſwaded in yeelding obedience in this behalfe, yet both the ſorts of theſe men are for their doings condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the ſight of God, for that their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in all reſpects are found and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to be contrary to his holy will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in his Word.</p>
               <p>It may be that for the <hi>matter</hi> of ſome of their works, the hypocrites can often fetch their warrant from God himſelfe, and that they are ſuch in reſpect of matter, as God himſelfe in his Word hath commanded, as namely, <hi>almeſ</hi>-gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, <hi>prarer</hi> and <hi>fasting,</hi> and yet in the <hi>forme</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> of working herein, they are found alwayes to <hi>differ</hi> from the faithfull: and therefore the man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate,

               <p>As in the <hi>manner</hi> there is a manifeſt difference to bee found betwixt the workes of the faithfull, and the workes

                  <pb n="424" facs="tcp:12058:221"/>broached by Satan himſelfe, the author of all miſchiefe, &amp; therefore very preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall vnto mans ſaluation, and not in any hand to be of vs receiued, or harke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto: yea, which is more, it is found to be very <hi>iniurious,</hi> euen to all the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the Deity, in that their eternall decree is thereby, as far as Satan can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, falſified &amp; made fruſtrate &amp; voyd. Nay, this rather ought to be written and regiſtred for an vndoubted and euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting truth in the heart, &amp; vpon the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of euery faithful &amp; Chriſtian ſoule, that they that are once thorowly and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually called &amp; regenerate, can <hi>neuer fall away for euer,</hi> but ſhall &amp; muſt conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue &amp; perſeuer vnto the end: <hi>Once rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate</hi> &amp; in the ſtate of grace, <hi>and euer ſo,</hi> whatſoeuer Satan &amp; thy ſinful fleſh can deuiſe &amp; practiſe againſt thee.

For to ſay that <hi>the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect</hi> of God, hauing once <hi>aſſurance</hi> of

And then what greater comfort ſhould the faithfull and Regenerate finde in thoſe promiſes then the faithleſſe and Reprobate? And further what benefit or comfort could grow to the faithfull, by thoſe three laſt Articles of our Creed, <hi>I beleeue the Remiſsion of ſinnes, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the body, and the life euerlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> if they could not alſo bee aſſured that they ſhould hereafter bee made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of them?

And to this end and purpoſe onely, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the courſe and order of the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of <hi>Christ,</hi> the Apoſtles, and all the faithfull Miniſters of all ages, vvho haue diligently taught the Children of

And therefore though the Scriptures doe ſpeake in this manner, to warne vs of our <hi>infirmitie,</hi> that wee ſhould not in any hand truſt too much vnto our owne ſtrength; but ſhould wholly and altogether put our confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the grace of God, who wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth all, in all his Choſen: yet it doth nothing preiudice the <hi>truth</hi> of this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>perſeuerance,</hi> which is not ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in <hi>our ſelues:</hi> but wholly and alone in the continuall helpe and aſſiſtance of the <hi>holy Ghoſt.</hi>
